</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Many neurological, cognitive and psychiatric disorders have been shown to affect connectivity between functional brain networks [1–24] even in so-called "resting" conditions where subjects are not engaged in a task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Network connectivity is typically assessed as a stationary feature of the data, inferred from the correlation or mutual information between pairs of network activation timecourses that extend through the duration of the scan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although a useful simplification, there is no a priori reason to believe that network correlations are stationary, especially in the resting brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In fact, one might expect cross-network connections to vary and evolve as subjects experience different thoughts, degrees of drowsiness, memories and emotional states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Far from being canonical, scan duration is simply one of the unavoidably fixed features of any functional imaging study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, averaging evidence of connectivity over an entire resting fMRI scan puts researchers at risk of obscuring distinct, meaningful connectivity regimes that subjects are passing through (Fig 1A and 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations of dynamic connectivity have in fact shown not only that connections are varying through time [25–36], but that this variation takes different forms in different demographic [35] and diagnostic [16, 26, 30, 32, 33, 37–39] groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The existence of the two connectivity regimes and the transitions between them are completely obscured by looking at correlation on a longer timescale; (C and D) Too crude a dimensionality-reduction of the state space can create serious distortions of the dynamics being analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Dynamically active and mobile trajectories (C) can appear constant under the reduction, while those barely moving from their starting position (D) can seem highly dynamic; (E) Shifting up one dimension and characterizing the same trajectories by vectors reflecting their position In a discrete 2-dimensional state space yields much better qualitative agreement between the geometric trajectories and their symbolic representations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0149849.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most work on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) to date has been focused on computing and statistically summarizing cross-network correlations evaluated separately on successive sliding windows through the original scan-length network timecourses [16, 25, 26, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The resulting window-indexed correlation matrices, called windowed functional network connectivity matrices (wFNC), record snapshots of network connectivity evolving in time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The collection of wFNCs for a given subject yields N(N−1)2 length-T timeseries, one for each of network-pair correlation, where T is the number of windows and N the number of networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The very first investigations [25, 26] of dynamic FNC used clustering as a dimensionality reduction tool, collapsing a d=N(N−1)N&gt;1000 dimensional connectivity space to just one dimension (ie., replacing an over 1000-dimensional object with the index i ∈ {1,2,…,k} of the cluster to which it belongs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although some interesting results have emerged from this initial work, collapsing connectivity space onto a single dimension is the crudest possible dimension-reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A reduction of this magnitude inevitably obscures and distorts important features of dynamical network-coupling behavior (Fig 1C, 1D and 1E) that might characterize clinically or demographically defined groups </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our approach models windowed FNCs as weighted sums of maximally independent connectivity patterns (CPs) (Fig 2C and 2D), Fig 3A and 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Each wFNC is recast as a discretized vector of CP weights, called a meta-state (Fig 2(A), Fig 3(C)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This specific approach was motivated by a desire to understand network connectivity dynamics in terms of (not necessarily observable) patterns of signed network pair correlations that “pipe in” and fade out of observed wFNCs in a relatively independent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We introduce a set of simple dynamism measures easily calculated from subject trajectories through the induced discrete five-dimensional state-space, finding consistent, significant and replicable differences in connectivity dynamics between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (Fig 2B and 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>While the temporal behavior of specific network-pair correlations might be of interest in certain narrowly tailored questions, it seems natural to address complex brain diseases that encompass diverse categories and combinations of symptoms at a more aggregated level, examining how patterns or aggregates of network-pair correlations evolve en masse in afflicted populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Schizophrenia is such a disease, and at the whole-brain level, we find very robust evidence of reduced dynamic fluidity and range in network correlation structure for patients suffering from this varied and complex disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous weighted contributions, called meta-states, of whole-brain patterns of connectivity to subject wFNCs change less often, and shift between a smaller number of more similar meta-states in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls (Fig 2(D)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Supporting a meta-state approach is the fact that this finding holds for sets of whole-brain network connectivity patterns, generally quite different from each other, derived using various data-driven approaches, including temporal independent component analysis (ICA), spatial ICA, principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means. </plain></SENT>
