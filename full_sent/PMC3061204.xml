</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic review was designed, undertaken and reported using items from the PRISMA statement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A literature search was conducted using the terms ‘Fast ForWord’ ‘Fast For Word’ ‘Fastforword’ with no restriction on dates of publication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following screening of (a) titles and abstracts and (b) full papers, using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, six papers were identified as meeting the criteria for inclusion (randomised controlled trial (RCT) or matched group comparison studies with baseline equivalence published in refereed journals). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The programs developed from a theory that claims language and literacy learning difficulties in children may arise from impairments in rapid auditory temporal processing skills (Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1973; Tallal, 1980; Reed, 1989; Tallal, Miller, &amp; Fitch, 1993; Tallal et al., 1996; Tallal, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A corollary of this theory is that, given neuroplasticity, appropriate training can lead to lasting improvements in underlying neural systems and concomitant improvements in children's language and reading skills (Merzenich &amp; Jenkins, 1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Early studies used a precursor to Fast ForWord on small groups of children with specific language impairment (SLI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Two linked papers by Tallal et al. (1996) and Merzenich et al. (1996) reported data from two small-scale studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the first study, which lacked a control group, it was reported that 7 children with language impairments showed improvements on measures of language skills after just 4 weeks' training with a computer-based program using acoustically modified speech. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A second, small-scale non-randomised study of 22 children, described in the same articles, compared the effectiveness of an equivalent training program either with, or without, the acoustically modified speech component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It was claimed that the children in the acoustically modified speech group made greater gains on measures of language ability, although these gains would not be reliable based on a conventional (2-tailed) statistical test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We believe that the design limitations (very small sample sizes, and only the second study included a control group but did not use random assignment) and the absence of statistically reliable effects (the effects were reliable on a 1-tailed test only in the second study) preclude any strong claims for the effectiveness of Fast ForWord from these studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Based on these early studies, Fast ForWord was launched as a commercial product by the Scientific Learning Corporation, and it is claimed that the program results in a ‘wide range of improved critical language and reading skills’ (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scilearnglobal.com/the-fast-forword-program/">http://www.scilearnglobal.com/the-fast-forword-program/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Fast ForWord is a suite of computer programs that contain language-based audiovisual games designed around themes intended to engage children aged between 4 and 14 years with language difficulties (Scientific Learning Corporation, 1999; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scilearnglobal.com/">http://www.scilearnglobal.com/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Forword">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Forword</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The games are adaptive and contain speech that is acoustically modified by a two-stage processing algorithm (Nagarajan et al., 1998) and adapt with the child's progress, gradually decreasing modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The program also incorporates other language training elements, akin to those used by speech and language therapists, in order to ‘cross-train’ many different skills at the same time (Tallal, 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Fast ForWord was launched commercially in 1997, and is now used in many schools and clinics in the USA, Canada and Australia as well as in the UK and other countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In a scope of use study by the What Works Clearinghouse (2007) it was estimated that Fast ForWord has been used by over 570,000 children in more than 3,700 schools in the US, with the Scientific Learning Corporation (1999) claiming language gains of 1½ to 2 years in a training period of only 4 to 8 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, there is much controversy over the effectiveness of Fast ForWord (Cirrin &amp; Gillam, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Many of the claims which the Scientific Learning Corporation make appear to be based on findings from their privately conducted and non-peer-reviewed studies (Scientific Learning Corporation, 1999, 2003) rather than independent studies published in peer-reviewed journals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is still unclear as to whether the improvements observed in these studies are directly related to the acoustically modified speech component of the program. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A scoping review, carried out as background to the present review, revealed four existing systematic reviews dealing with the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The first review was a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of Fast ForWord on academic performance in general (Sisson, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The second reviewed general language interventions for children with spoken language disorders (Cirrin &amp; Gillam, 2008); two reviews, conducted by the What Works Clearinghouse, were intervention effectiveness reports looking at the effects of Fast ForWord on beginner readers and Fast ForWord-Language on English language learners (What Works Clearinghouse, 2007, 2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Sisson (2009) carried out a systematic review of studies measuring the efficacy of Fast ForWord and located 31 studies which met inclusion criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Effect sizes were computed across many areas of academic skill; however, Fast ForWord was found to have no particular effect on any of the skills analysed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The computed mean effect size was found to be small and pooled effect sizes for each skill were also subject to much variability, suggesting that there are no significant effects of Fast ForWord on academic performance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Cirrin and Gillam (2008) reviewed studies of language intervention practices published since 1985 which involved school-aged children who were diagnosed with spoken language disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A search of electronic databases and a hand search of other sources located 21 studies that the authors judged to have used suitably stringent procedures for evaluating general language interventions; of these, five studies involved Fast ForWord. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The conclusion drawn from this review is that programs such as Fast ForWord are ‘neither necessary nor sufficient to induce significant changes in processing or expressive and receptive language skills’ (Cirrin &amp; Gillam, 2008, p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>S129). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In a report on the effects of Fast ForWord on beginner readers (kindergarten to third grade) published by the What Works Clearinghouse (2007), five studies were located which met their standards and an additional study was included with reservations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was assessed by outcome measures of phonic reading skills (phonological awareness, phonics and letter knowledge) and comprehension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This report concludes that there are positive effects of Fast ForWord on phonic reading skills but mixed effects on comprehension outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>However, the procedures used and the conclusions drawn from this review have been roundly criticised by McArthur (2008); in particular, McArthur argued that this review was largely based on unpublished studies conducted by the Scientific Learning Corporation and failed to include a key study that was published in a peer-reviewed journal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The What Works Clearinghouse (2006) intervention report for Fast ForWord Language on English language learners reviewed one paper which met evidence standards and one which met them with reservations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These studies focused on phonological awareness, reading achievement and English language development outcome measures in children between kindergarten and sixth grade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The conclusions of this review are that Fast ForWord Language could have a positive effect on English language development but no apparent influence on reading achievement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The evidence from existing reviews of the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program appears unpromising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Given the fact that this program is in such widespread use it seems a matter of some importance and urgency to establish whether the program can be deemed to be effective, and if so, for which skills. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>With this aim in mind, this paper reports a systematic meta-analytic review of evidence for the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report a meta-analysis of all the studies of Fast ForWord that we could identify that have used an appropriate design (see below for details). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We assess the effects of the program on the four critical areas that have been most studied and that are of clear practical and clinical relevance (standardised measures of Single Word Reading, Passage Reading Comprehension, Receptive Vocabulary and Expressive Vocabulary). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were set out in the systematic review Protocol (Appendix A, online) written before the search was initiated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials or quasi-experiments with a treatment group taking part in the Fast ForWord intervention and at least one other group receiving either no intervention or an alternative treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The groups had to be equivalent at baseline after being either randomly assigned or matched. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We adopted these criteria for inclusion, because we believe that these designs are the only ones that permit well-founded conclusions about the effectiveness of an intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Measures used to assess language abilities in trials had to be standardised tests of reading or oral language. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>However, in terms of the risk of bias assessment tool the studies did vary somewhat, with only two stating that the allocation was concealed and only three stating that outcome ascertainment was undertaken blind to group allocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Attrition was fairly high in four of the studies, but the studies by Borman, Benson, and Overman (2009) and Rouse and Krueger (2004) noted this factor and undertook both intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses and instrumental variable (IV) or LATE analyses. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Gillam et al. (2008) published a composite score for receptive and expressive vocabulary, so these combined means were entered for both measures of oral language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>A primary measure in this study, the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999), is a standardised test of both expressive and receptive language with strong psychometric properties and high reliability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The composite score was produced by taking the sum of various subtests which were selected specifically for children of differing ages (7–10-year-olds), and although only one subtest was used for 6-year-old children, this was not part of the core composite score. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>For this study, the ‘LiPS’ active control was selected rather than the ‘Earobics’ group on the basis that it was stated in the introduction of the paper that this intervention had been used more frequently in published studies and there was no empirical evidence of the effectiveness of Earobics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Standardised effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all pre-specified outcome measures in each study were computed by dividing the mean difference between groups at post-test by a pooled standard deviation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>This was carried out for each of the four outcome measures and for comparisons involving both active and untreated control groups. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Studies which did not contain one of the measures were excluded from that specific analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>The results of the meta-analyses we conducted are remarkably clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>For the 4 analyses of Fast ForWord compared to untreated control groups, the pooled effect size was .079 (95% CI −.09 to .25), .17 (95% CI −.17 to .52) for passage comprehension, .01 (95% CI −.25 to .28) for receptive language and −.04 (95%−.33 to .25) for expressive language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>For comparisons with the treated control groups the equivalent pooled effect sizes were −.026 (95% CI −.40 to .35), −.10 (95% CI −.40 to .21) for passage comprehension, .02 (95% CI −.27 to .31) for receptive language and −.06 (95%−.33 to .20) for expressive language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>None of the 8 pooled effect sizes were reliably different from zero, and 4 of the effect sizes were actually negative (indicating worse performance in the Fast ForWord treatment group than the control group). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The negative results from this meta-analysis actually align well with the results from three other training studies that we did not include in this review. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The first study, by Borman et al. (2009), could not be included in our meta-analysis because the published paper does not give the data necessary for the computation of effect sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>This study is a high-quality randomised field trial that evaluated the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program in eight schools, with random assignment of children within schools to the treatment or no-treatment control groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The study appears to have been conducted in collaboration with the Scientific Learning Corporation, the developers of the Fast ForWord program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>The findings reported in this paper are nevertheless entirely consistent with the pattern obtained from our meta-analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>In an analysis based on 107 children the effect of the Fast ForWord treatment on Language outcome (d = +.08) was positive but non-significant and on Reading Comprehension outcome (d = −.07) was negative but non-significant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>There are two other studies that we did not include because they did not use the commercially available Fast ForWord program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>These two studies used the same sample of children who were given both forms of intervention at the same time. Bishop, Adams, Lehtonen, and Rosen (2005) reported a small-scale study of a computerised program for training spelling skills given to children with language impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>In this program the children attempted to spell words presented as pictures on a computer screen and when they could not do so they were provided with spoken prompts (the next sound from the word that was to be written) using either natural or acoustically modified speech. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The modified speech condition used the same computer algorithm used in Fast ForWord. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Children in the study succeeded in learning some of the trained words but the training did not appear to generalise since the trained children did not make any greater gains on a standardised spelling test than an untrained control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Most significantly, in relation to the current review, the trend was for children trained with the acoustically modified speech to make less progress than those trained with natural speech, and this was true even for children who were shown, using experimental measures, to have auditory temporal processing impairments (for whom the modified speech should have been effective). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Bishop, Adams, and Rosen (2006) used a computerised grammatical training program with children with receptive language impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>In this study they compared the effectiveness of acoustically modified speech (using the same computer algorithm as Fast ForWord) with a normal speech condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The two trained groups did not differ from an untrained control group on measures of auditory language skills; furthermore, once again there was no sign that the acoustically modified speech group did better than the children in the unmodified speech condition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>In summary, these two small-scale, well-controlled studies also failed to find evidence for the effectiveness of using acoustically modified speech (comparable to that used in Fast ForWord) for training the language and literacy skills of children with language impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the Borman et al. (2009) study failed to find evidence for the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program from a randomised field trial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Practical and theoretical implications </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>This review clearly provides no support for the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord program as a treatment for children with language and literacy impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>We certainly need to be cautious, insofar as null results can never demonstrate the absence of an effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>However, from an applied perspective the current review suggests that the Fast ForWord program cannot be endorsed as a suitable treatment for children with oral language or reading difficulties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>In our opinion the studies reviewed here were adequate methodologically, and had reasonable to large sample sizes; therefore, even if the effects from the Fast ForWord program were small, the studies reviewed should have been able to detect them. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>The finding that Fast ForWord is not effective in remediating children's language difficulties might at first appear to refute the theory underlying the program (that language learning problems are caused by a rapid auditory temporal processing deficit). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>However, in order to refute the theory that language learning problems in some children may be caused by a rapid auditory temporal processing deficit, it would be necessary to show that suitable training for such children can produce substantial improvements in rapid auditory processing skills, without producing concomitant improvements in language skills. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Only one study included in this review (Gillam et al., 2008) included a measure of rapid auditory temporal processing (auditory backward masking). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>This study found that Fast ForWord was no more effective in improving this measure than either of two alternative treatments that did not involve acoustically modified speech. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>These findings certainly throw considerable doubt on the claims made by the developers of Fast ForWord that suitable training can remediate rapid auditory processing problems and in turn improve the language skills of children with language impairments (cf. Tallal et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>In one other relevant experimental study, McArthur, Ellis, Atkinson, and Coltheart (2008) studied groups of children with SLI and reading disorders and found that a large proportion of these children showed abnormalities on a range of auditory psychophysical measures (including measures of rapid auditory temporal processing). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>The children with auditory processing deficits were given intensive training over 6 weeks targeting their auditory processing weaknesses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The training was successful in remediating these children's basic auditory processing weaknesses, but this did not transfer to effects on measures of oral language or spelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Thus in this study training was effective in remediating auditory processing skills, but had no transfer effects to literacy or language measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>It remains important for future studies in this area to establish whether (a) suitable training programs can be developed that can produce improvements in children's rapid auditory temporal processing, and (b) if so, whether such improvements are associated with (i.e., mediate) corresponding improvements in language processing skills. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Given that these were the explicit aims of the developers of Fast ForWord, the negative evidence from the study by Gillam et al. (2008) and McArthur et al. (2008) is certainly not encouraging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>A full review of other forms of treatment for children with language and reading difficulties is beyond the scope of this paper, but it may worth considering briefly how the results reviewed here concerning Fast ForWord compare with the results of studies using different (more conventional) forms of therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>If we consider interventions for children with oral language difficulties there are not large numbers of randomised controlled trials, and arguably some of the ones that do exist are of low methodological quality (see, Laws, Garrett, &amp; Nye, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the evidence from the meta-analysis of therapy studies by Laws et al. does show that one of the primary outcome measures considered here (Expressive Vocabulary) is associated with large effect sizes for standardised measures of expressive vocabulary (d = .98; n = 74; 95% CI −.5–2.56), measures of the number of words used in expressive language samples (d = 1.08; n = 82; 95% CI .61–1.55), and parental ratings of vocabulary usage (d = .89; n = 136; 95% CI .21–1.56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Thus there is reasonable evidence that conventional forms of therapy (which include direct teaching of vocabulary) are effective in improving vocabulary knowledge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>There are many studies of the effectiveness of remedial teaching methods for children with reading (decoding) difficulties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>One of the primary outcome measures for the present meta-analysis was single word reading and there is very good evidence that difficulties in developing accurate word reading skills can be effectively ameliorated with phonically based reading instruction coupled with phoneme awareness training. Bus and van IJzendoorn (1999) and the National Reading Panel (NRP) in the US (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000) both reported meta-analyses of relevant studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Bus and van IJzendoorn reported that phonological awareness training improved reading skills (d = .44) and this effect did not differ significantly for typical versus struggling readers (d = .40 vs. .60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>In line with this, the NRP meta-analysis (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000) also found that phoneme awareness training produced a moderate and reliable effect on reading outcomes (d = .53). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>In summary there is relatively good evidence that conventional forms of therapy have larger effects on some key language and reading outcomes than those reported in this meta-analytic review of Fast ForWord. </plain></SENT>
