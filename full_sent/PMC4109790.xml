</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Meiosis is a specialized cell division process, which includes premeiotic DNA synthesis, DNA recombination followed by two rounds of cell division, and gametogenesis [1-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It has been shown in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe[5-8] and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae[1,9-12] that a number of transcription factors dramatically modulate the transcriptome to facilitate meiosis, thereby playing critical roles in meiotic progression and sporulation (gametogenesis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition to transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in the progression of meiosis and gametogenesis in higher eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, cessation of transcription followed by complex translational activation and repression of stored maternal mRNAs occurs in Xenopus oocytes during meiotic progression (oocyte maturation) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In fission yeast, a specialized regulation of meiosis, called selective elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs, facilitates the post-transcriptional degradation of meiotic mRNAs during the mitotic cell cycle [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We were interested in elucidating any additional post-transcriptional regulation that might contribute to the dynamic changes observed in gene expression during meiosis in the fission yeast. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The spo5 mutant was isolated as a sporulation-deficient mutant in the original genetic screen of defective mutants in meiotic progression and/or sporulation, performed nearly half a century ago [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that the spo5+ gene encodes a meiosis-specific RNA-binding protein, carrying two RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) in the C-terminal part (aas 192–567), and regulates the progression of meiosis II and spore formation [16-20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although it seems apparent that Spo5 plays an essential role to coordinate meiosis and sporulation, controlling a number of targets, the RNA molecules that bind to Spo5 have not yet been identified, except for our recent finding that cdc13 +  mRNA, encoding cyclin B, can do so [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Because Spo5 is likely to be involved in post-transcriptional events during meiosis, such as pre-mRNA processing, mRNA export, translation, and mRNA degradation, we analyzed this RNA-binding protein to evaluate its functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate that the RRMs on Spo5 are essential for its cytoplasmic localization, where it exerts its function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Spo5 appears to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the Rae1-dependent mRNA export pathway, but is unlikely to be involved in general mRNA export. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We also show that one of the critical target RNA molecules for Spo5 is pcr1 +  mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Pcr1 belongs to the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, which consists of four members in fission yeast: Pcr1, Atf1, Atf21, and Atf31. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>First, we evaluated the mechanism underlying the subcellular localization of Spo5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A previous study suggested that the C-terminal half of Spo5 is required for its cytoplasmic localization [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As this region contains the RRMs, we examined whether these might be responsible for the localization of Spo5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We constructed a series of truncation mutants that lacked the RRM region (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Each mutant carried the mutated spo5 gene in place of the wild-type gene on the chromosome, and expressed the mutant protein from the authentic spo5 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>All truncated mutant proteins that lacked at least one RRM showed abnormal nuclear accumulation, as indicated by the fluorescent signals of fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that mutant proteins were produced in a comparable amount to wild-type Spo5, by examining the shortest mutant Spo5(1–296) and the RRM2-deletion mutant, although the protein level might be slightly lower in the latter case (Additional 1: Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The RRM truncation mutants were defective in sporulation (Figure 1B), suggesting that the existence of intact RRMs is correlated with the cytoplasmic localization and proper function of Spo5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>While we could not exclude the possibility that some of the effect of the mutations on sporulation might be due to lower levels of the mutant proteins, the effect on sporulation was apparently more dramatic than the effect on protein levels, supporting the importance of the RRMs/cytoplasmic localization in Spo5 function.There was one exception, namely Spo5(1–456)-GFP, which has two RRMs but lacks the C-terminal region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Although it localized mostly to the cytoplasm, it was not functional, whereas Spo5(1–525)-GFP, which has two RRMs and an additional C-terminal portion, was functional (Figure 1A,B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This indicates that, in addition to intact RRMs, the C-terminal region adjacent to the second RRM is essential for the Spo5 function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We constructed mutant strains that were similar to the F341A and F427A mutations previously analyzed by Kasama and colleagues [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>All of the mutant proteins, namely Spo5(F341A)–GFP, Spo5(F427A)–GFP, and Spo5(F341A, F427A)–GFP, accumulated in the nucleus, as did the RRM-truncated proteins (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>These mutants were also deficient in sporulation (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Similar, or slightly lower production of Spo5(F341A, F427A) protein compared to the wild-type was confirmed (Additional file 1: Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The nuclear localization of these mutated Spo5-GFP proteins in our study was somewhat different from that observed in the previous study, which reported that Spo5(F341A, F427A)-GFP shows a punctate distribution in both the cytoplasm and nucleus [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Our precise analysis suggested that Spo5(F341A, F427A) protein might exhibit punctate cytoplasmic distribution during early meiotic stages such as the horsetail-movement and one-nucleus stages (Additional file 2: Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The apparent difference in localization may also reflect changes in the strain construction: In the previous study, the spo5 mutant allele was integrated into the chromosomal leu1 locus, whereas the mutant allele was integrated in the authentic spo5 locus in our case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>However, the actual reasons remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We also performed a genetic screen for novel missense mutants of spo5 that were defective in meiosis and sporulation, and isolated more than ten different mutants including spo5(F341L) and spo5(S365P), both of which contained a mutation in the RRM domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>When assayed at 30°C, Spo5(F341L)–GFP accumulated in the nucleus as did Spo5(F341A)–GFP, but Spo5(S365P)–GFP did not, showing a unique phenotype (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Because aromatic residues in the RRM, such as F341, have been shown to interact directly with RNA [22], we speculated that the RNA-binding of Spo5 might be important for its cytoplasmic localization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Spo5 localizes to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export pathway </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>RRMs appear to be essential for the translocation of Spo5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether Spo5 might be exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery using a mutant of the mRNA export factor, Rae1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The Rae1-dependent pathway is conserved from the budding yeast [23] to humans [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The fission yeast rae1-167 mutant exhibited defective mRNA export at restrictive temperatures [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We induced meiosis in wild-type (WT) and rae1-167 cells at 25°C, the latter of which produced Spo5 protein in a comparable or slightly lower amount (Additional file 1: Figure S1), and transferred the cells to 36°C to inactivate Rae1-167. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In WT cells, Spo5–GFP was mainly localized to the cytoplasm both at 25°C and 36°C (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Spo5–GFP accumulated in the nucleus in rae1-167 cells at the restrictive temperature (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This suggests that Spo5 is likely to be exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this idea, Spo5 accumulated in the nucleus when mRNA synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline (Figure 2B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>We also noticed that sporulation was markedly inefficient in rae1-167 cells (spo5-GFP rae1 + , 83% vs. spo5-GFP rae1-167, 19%), indicating that Rae1 plays an important role in meiotic progression and sporulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>When the Ran–exportin nuclear export pathway was blocked with leptomycin B (LMB), a potent inhibitor of exportin/Crm1 [28], Spo5–GFP remained in the cytoplasm (Figure 2D), demonstrating that exportin/Crm1 is dispensable for the export of Spo5. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Pabp–GFP was found to localize in the cytoplasm in spo5∆ cells (Figure 2E), suggesting that Spo5 is not an mRNA export factor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we conclude that Spo5 is exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery, but is unlikely to be involved in global mRNA export. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Fission yeast Rae1 may also promote meiosis by transporting mRNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Some RNA-binding proteins are also known to be exported to the cytoplasm through binding to mRNAs [31-33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The mRNA-dependent nuclear export of RNA-binding proteins may emerge as a more universal phenomenon among eukaryotes than previously anticipated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study indicated that mutations in RRMs caused abnormal nuclear accumulation and loss of function of Spo5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the mRNA-dependent nuclear export of Spo5 is required for its function, although it is also possible that the loss of RNA-binding in Spo5 resulted in its abnormal localization as a secondary effect. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Although the addition of NLS appeared to make the protein less stable (Additional file 1: Figure S1), cells expressing Spo5–NLS–GFP accumulated the fusion proteins detectably in the nucleus, indicating that the NLS sequence was functional (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The sporulation efficiency of these cells was significantly reduced, and they produced abnormally shaped spores or asci with less than four spores (Figure 3B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>While the destabilization of Spo5–NLS was likely to contribute largely to the sporulation defect, enforced nuclear migration of Spo5 also appeared to abolish its function to promote meiosis and sporulation, suggesting that the nuclear export of Spo5 is important for its optimal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The viability of the spores generated in spo5-NLS-GFP cells was comparable to that of the control (spo5-GFP, 50% vs. spo5-NLS-GFP 40%), implying that the loss of Spo5 function did not affect the germination potential. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>It was also evident that Spo5 could regulate factors other than Pcr1 that are important for meiotic progression and sporulation, because Pcr1 could not suppress sporulation defects of spo5∆ as efficiently as Spo5 itself (Additional file 4: Figure S4B), although pcr1 +  overexpression increased the amount of pcr1 +  mRNA in spo5∆ cells to a higher level than spo5 +  overexpression (Additional file 4: Figure S4C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>While Spo5C bound to atf21 +  RNA to some extent (Figure 5C, lanes 7 and 8), probably because of its weak non-specific affinity for RNA, which we noticed previously [21], it was clear that Spo5C could bind to pcr1 +  RNA more strongly than atf21 +  RNA, as 50 ng of the protein was enough to shift pcr1 +  RNA (Figure 5C, lane 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study indicated that Spo5 is exported to the cytoplasm via the mRNA export machinery, but not via the Ran–exportin/Crm1 system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The binding of Spo5 to mRNAs through its two RRMs appears to enable its nuclear export, and this RNA-binding activity is essential not only for the nuclear export, but also for its function in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Spo5 is unlikely to be involved in general mRNA export, suggesting that it may instead be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation occurring in the cytoplasm, such as control of mRNA stability and/or translational initiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified a novel binding target of Spo5, pcr1+ mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the pcr1+ gene suppressed the sporulation deficiency of spo5 mutants, demonstrating that pcr1+ mRNA is a critical target of Spo5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>However, Pcr1 suppressed the defect in spo5∆  cells less efficiently than Spo5, suggesting that Spo5 may also regulate factors important for meiotic progression and sporulation other than Pcr1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Suppression of spo5 by overexpression of cdc13+ is also partial [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to identify other important targets of Spo5 and the possible role that Spo5 plays in the post-transcriptional regulation of pcr1+ mRNA and other mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
