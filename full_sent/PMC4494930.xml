</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins belong to the RING finger protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, consisting of 11 members in mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MARCH proteins have numerous cellular functions, which include immune regulation, protein quality control, membrane trafficking, and spermatogenesis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MARCH7 is a member of the MARCH family, which consists of approximately 690 amino acids within a single RING finger domain [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that MARCH7 plays an important role in T cell proliferation and neuronal development [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MARCH7 is expressed in multiple types of cells and tissues, including stem cells and precursor cells [4], suggesting its possible role in cell and tissue differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the cellular localization and function of MARCH7 in ovarian carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have observed an aberrant expression and localization of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer tissues by immunohistochemical analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we have elucidated the functions of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our results show that MARCH7 participates in the regulation of cytoskeleton re-organization, cellular migration and invasion, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis in ovarian carcinoma cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>At the same time, we found that MARCH 7 could modulate nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further, we identified MARCH7 was an authentic target of miR-101. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Until now, there is no study implicating MARCH7 in the pathogenesis of cancer, the mechanisms of MARCH7 in cancer development and progression are poorly known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>NF κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathway are involved in cancer development and progression, in various carcinomas including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer [17-23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In human ovarian carcinoma, there is constitutive activation of NF-κB, which leads to uncontrolled growth, anti-apoptosis, and immune evasion [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that ectopic expression of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer cells increased NF-κB activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>In contrast, downregulation of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer decreased NF-κB activity, especially the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-kB protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>NF-kB p65 is the major subunit involved in ovarian cancer development and progression [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, the silencing of MARCH7 expression in ovarian cancer reduced P50 and P65 protein levels; ectopic expression of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer increased the protein level of P50 and P65. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>We also observed that upregulation MARCH7 in ovarian cancer A2780 cells promoted the P50 and P65 translocation to the nucleus; downregulation of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells inhibited P50 and P65 translocation to the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>To further study the relation between MARCH7 and NF kB, we tried inhibiting NF kB with PDTC (Ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate), P50 siRNA or/and P65 siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>We found that PDTC, P50 siRNA or/and P65 siRNA significantly reduced the mRNA and protein level of MARCH7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This suggested that NF kB can regulate the expression of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that NF kB interaction with MARCH7 was crucial for the progress of ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Elevation of β-catenin in the cytosol and the nucleus can occur independently through various pathways [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, β-catenin is a central factor in canonical Wnt signaling [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>We found that ectopic expression of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer A2780 cells increased the expression of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and promote its translocation to the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells decreased the expression of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and repressed its translocation to the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed that MARCH7 promoted β-catenin translocation to the nucleus in ovarian cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Once within the nucleus, β-catenin regulates expression of genes involved in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including sp5, lef1 and c-myc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We had shown that MARCH7 upregulated β-catenin, therefore, to test whether MARCH7 may also be implicated in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we investigated its regulatory effect on TopFlash reporter activity, sp5, lef1 and c-myc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that MARCH7 mediated TopFlash reporter activity and expression of sp5, lef1, and c-myc mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we concluded that MARCH7 participated in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human ovarian cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>β-catenin involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway and intercellular adhesion, which is causally correlated with the existence of E-cadherin and catenin complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The adhesive properties of E-cadherin correlated with the junctions with β-catenin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In cancer cells, it plays an important role in cell signaling due to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which impedes β-catenin degradation in the cytoplasm, resulting in protein accumulation and transport to the cell nucleus to activate the transcription of many genes [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that ectopic expression of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer A2780 cells reduced the protein levels of E-cadherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In contrast, silencing of MARCH7 expression in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells significantly increased the protein level of E-cadherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>It indicates that MARCH7 reduced E-cadherin to promote β-catenin transport to the cell nucleus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-101 is decreased in epithelial ovarian cancer compared with normal tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>MiR-101 ectopic expression in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines resulted in increased apoptosis, decreased cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and reduced growth of tumor xenografts [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that miR-101 mimics reduced the mRNA and protein level of MARCH7 in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>We further confirmed miR-101 inhibited MARCH7 expression by targeting its mRNA 3′UTR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study confirms that MARCH7 is a tumor promoting gene in humans with ovarian cancer, which was involved in NFkB and Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>S2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This also suggests that MARCH7 may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
