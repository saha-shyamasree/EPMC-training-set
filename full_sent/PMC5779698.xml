</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The native starch granule appears to be a poor substrate for most amylolytic enzymes and one of the crucial steps in initiating starch degradation is its phosphorylation [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Plant starch phosphorylation date since more than 120 years ago and starch phosphate content depend on the plant origin: i.e. cereal starch contains 30-fold less phosphate than tuber starch [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation process is carried out by the glucan water dikinase (GWD, which phosphorylates the C6-position of glucosyl residues) and phosphoglucan water dikinase (PWD, which phosphorylates the C3 position) enzymes [4–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The addition of phosphate groups to the polymer triggers a perturbation of the granule surface transforming the polysaccharide in a better substrate for the attack of exoamylolytic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the phosphate groups can also obstruct some glucan hydrolytic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, it has recently become clear that dephosphorylation of glucans is also essential for normal storage polysaccharide degradation in plants as well as in mammals [9–13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from a wide variety of substrates that includes proteins, glucans, nucleic acids and lipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoglucan phosphatases starch excess 4 (SEX4) and like-SEX4 2 (LSF2) are fundamental components in the remobilization of leaf starch at night since they dephosphorylate glucans to provide access to amylases to release maltose and glucose [10, 13–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The absence of these phosphatases disrupts starch breakdown, resulting in plants that accumulate starch in excess [15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The most outstanding example of the importance of glucan phosphatases in human biology is the Lafora disease, an autosomal recessive disorder which causes neuronal deterioration with accumulation of insoluble, intracellular, hyperphosphorylated carbohydrates called Lafora bodies [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Lafora disease is caused by mutations in either the gene encoding Laforin (a glucan phosphatase) or Malin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) [12, 18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Many studies have postulated that glucan phosphatase activity is required to regulate the metabolism of storage carbohydrates or amylopectin-like material across multiple kingdoms [10, 13, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, there is no information available about the function of these enzymes in the ancestral green algae that evolve into present land plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Based on this, we decided to explore the presence and function of glucan phosphatases in the picoalgae Ostreococcus tauri. O. tauri is the smallest known free-living eukaryote and has a very simple genome and cellular organization although exhibiting the same degree of complexity as that of vascular plants regards to the starch metabolism pathways [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The present work reports the identification of a novel A. thaliana orthologue of LSF2 present in O. tauri. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We perform the biochemical characterization of the first green algae glucan phosphatase informed to date. O. tauri dual specific phosphatase, herein named OsttaDSP, was found to be a homodimeric enzyme with a Michaelis Menten-type hyperbolic response to amylopectin dephosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We also found that the C162 residue is important for its catalytic activity and presumably for conformational stability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These results could contribute to further understand phosphoglucan phosphatase’s role in starch reversible phosphorylation evolution in the green lineage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The analysis of O. tauri genome shows the presence of two DSP genes (Ot02g06340 and Ot13g02940) and five genes coding for five putative starch phosphorylating enzymes (Ot13g01510, Ot16g02370, Ot04g04170, Ot08g01260 and Ot08g01280). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>According to the in silico analysis, both DSP genes codify for LSF2 orthologs suggesting that the DSPs would be highly conserved throughout the green lineage, including the oldest genomes like O. tauri. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>As described previously, of the two DSP genes found in O. tauri, we continue working with Ot02g06340 because of its protein product (XP_003075237) has the highest identity to its plant counterpart LSF2 from A. thaliana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The full-length OsttaDSP gene (Ot02g06340) contains 816 bp and codes for a 245 amino acid mature polypeptide with high sequence identity with LSF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Like LSF2, OsttaLSF2 lacks a CBM reported up to date, but it efficiently binds and dephosphorylates amylopectin, constituting an active enzyme (Fig 3 and S4 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The structure of Arabidopsis LSF2 showed that this protein engages a glucan chain by an aromatic channel and two SBSs nearly 20 A° away from the active site [39, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>While the aromatic channel is fully conserved in OsttaDSP (green arrowheads in Fig 1A), this is not the case for SBS2 and SBS3 (Fig 1, red and blue arrowheads). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Since SBSs are short stretches of non-contiguous amino acids that come together to impart glucan binding, they have a heterogeneous topology, and there is no a strict SBS signature motif [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This is why is difficult to identify OsttaDSP SBSs just via bioinformatics tools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The biochemical characterization of OsttaDSP showed that it migrates as a single band in SDS-PAGE and native gels (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Using gel filtration chromatography, the enzyme was detected as a 54.4 kDa protein (S2 Fig), suggesting that OsttaDSP is a homodimer. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>As is known from previous studies, PTPs have the signature motif HCX5R, which contains the invariant cysteine residue at the base of the active site cleft [46, 47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This cysteine exists as an active thiolate anion during catalysis and is stabilized by the electrostatic interactions of the neighboring histidine [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The arginine of the signature motif coordinates the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate that is formed after a nucleophilic attack by the thiolate ion of cysteine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Transfer of the phosphate is promoted through the protonation of the dephosphorylated substrate by the aspartic acid residue located approximately 30 residues upstream the signature motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Phosphate is released after hydrolysis by the afore mentioned aspartate and a nearby glutamine to restore the thiolate anion. Arabidopsis thaliana LSF2 and SEX4 are active using pNPP or amylopectin as substrates, and within the DSP active-site, the conserved Cys was reported to be essential for activity [15, 20, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the corresponding Cys in LSF2 (Cys193) to Ser abolished its activity against pNPP and amylopectin (at 2.25 mg/ml) analogous to the C198S mutation in SEX4 [15, 20, 48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In this work, the mutated enzyme OsttaDSP C162S retains some activity at higher concentrations of amylopectin, but this activity is lost when pNPP was used as the substrate (Fig 4A and 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The single Cys to Ser aminoacidic substitution resulted in the change of hyperbolic kinetics to the sigmoidal one in response to amylopectin concentration (Fig 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>This explains why the enzyme shows very low activity at subsaturating amylopectin concentrations, but it retains about 40% of the wild type enzyme activity at saturating amounts of amylopectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In addition, the evidence detected by native electrophoresis showed that the formation of a homodimer might also be lost with the C162S mutation (Fig 5), suggesting an involvement of this residue both, in catalytic activity and structural stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>From the results presented here, we can infer that Cys162 is critical for OsttaDSP activity and that possibly local structural effects resulting from the Cys to Ser mutation renders the mutant enzyme capable of performing the dephosphorylation of amylopectin in the whole range of pH analyzed (Fig 4 and S3 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>However, further investigation is necessary to fully understand the implications of this conservative point mutation in the catalytic mechanism of OsttaDSP as well as in the final structure of the active site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Our results could contribute to a better understanding of starch metabolism in this microalga and provide the basis for a better evolutionary characterization of these dual nature phosphatases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>While SEX4 is described to hydrolyze both C6- and C3-bound phosphate, LSF2 is unique as it is highly specific for the C3-position of glucosyl residues of starch, although it also has low capacity to dephosphorylate some C6-esters [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The absence of a SEX4 ortholog n O. tauri raises the possibility that OsttaDSP displays both activities or that the dephosphorylation of C6-phosphorylated residues is carried out by the other DSP found in Ostreococcus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The determination of algae glucan phosphatases structures would reveal further insights into their mechanism of activity and specificity in particular because of the presence of SBSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Specific role(s) of the SBSs are an active area of research because the observed synergistic function could be due to altered dynamics from proximity effects, distinct binding preferences, or global effects on glucan stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the specific properties regarding the regulation of the polysaccharide metabolism are fundamental due to their potential biotechnological and industrial applications. </plain></SENT>
