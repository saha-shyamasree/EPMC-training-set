<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This syndecan-1 specific interaction of DR6 was consistent with the observation that the genome-wide screening identified only syndecan-1 as a binding molecule for the DR6-ectodomain (Fig. 3e). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of CD8+ T cells also expressed DR6. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>DR6+ CD4+ cells expressed Il-21 and Bcl6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The expression levels were lower than those observed in DR6low Tfh cells (Supplementary Fig. 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The up-regulated expression of DR6 on the T cell surface-regulated the threshold of DR6 activation to suppress activation of TCR signalling in the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>However, the up-regulated DR6 itself is insufficient for complete prevention of Tfh cells in lupus-prone BWF1 mice, because of the low amount of DR6 ligand on the surface of GC B cells that are the direct counter partners of the Tfh cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent studies have reported that CD4+ T cell populations exhibit disease-associated characteristics caused by several SLE-associated genetic mutations on murine chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7 and 18, leading to high activation and expansion of CD4+ T cell populations in lupus-prone mice37383940. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Although the murine Tnfrsf21 gene (on chromosome 17) is not in murine SLE-associated loci, the unique characteristics of the lupus CD4+ T cell populations emphasize the importance of DR6 functions in the regulation of CD4+ T cells in lupus-prone mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of DR6 expression was observed in Tfh cell populations of lupus-prone BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In contrast to lupus-prone mice, DR6 expression was low in Tfh cells of DNP-KLH- immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 12a,b, vertical axes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 (Supplementary Fig. 12b, horizontal axes) or Bcl6 (Supplementary Fig. 12c) expression in these cells was also low compared with that in Tfh cells of BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Collectively, Tfh cells of lupus-prone mice manifested their pathological characteristics compared with Tfh cells of healthy mice as expected, considering that lupus CD4+ T cell populations have a high sensitivity to TCR activation3739. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The TCR signal promoted high DR6 induction on Tfh cells of lupus-prone mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Recently, these pathological characteristics of lupus CD4+ T cells were shown to be caused by aberrant metabolic regulations, and are crucial for spontaneous induction of Tfh cell generation, GC formation, and disease symptoms in lupus-prone mice38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, such aberrant regulation of lupus CD4+ T cells is not associated with humoral responses against foreign antigens38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pathological cellular characteristics might involve high DR6 induction on auto reactive Tfh cells of severe lupus-prone BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We characterized syndecan-1 as a binding partner for DR6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Recombinant syndecan-1 stimulation was not capable of inducing cell death, except when it was highly concentrated (Supplementary Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This weak apoptotic effect of syndecan-1 stimulation is consistent with the weak apoptotic capability of DR6 compared with that of the other TNFRSF molecules, such as death receptor-4 (DR4)17 and -3 (DR3)41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This weak apoptotic activity of DR6 might depend on its low affinities of binding to Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which are key components for apoptotic caspase activation17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In addition, DR6 receptor cross-linking did not affect caspase activation in the cultured T-cell line (Supplementary Fig. 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, syndecan-1/DR6 interaction dramatically suppressed the activation of TCR signalling, which activates NFÎºB and NFAT in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In addition, DR6 gene deficiency in lymphocytes leads to hyper activation of NFÎºB or NFAT1920. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These findings and our data suggest that DR6 regulates lymphocyte activation by its negative regulation to NFÎºB and NFAT signalling rather than apoptotic function. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Syndecan-1 has multiple functions in immunological events and disease progression27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Syndecan-1 can attach to several chemokines, growth factors, and cytokines, suggesting that it has a scaffolding function for the accumulation of inflammatory cells in localized inflammation. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The 25-1 Ab was capable of DR6 cross-linking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Recombinant syndecan-1, as well as 25-1 Ab treatment, suppressed Il-21 production by Tfh cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the antibody should mimic the function of syndecan-1 that was reduced in BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>IL-21 production by Tfh cells is critical for both maintenance and development of GC B cells42. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 25-1 Ab or syndecan-1 should fine-tune the outcome of GC B/Tfh cell interactions, to prevent autoantibody production and disease progression in BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although 25-1 Ab preferentially bound to CD3+ T cells, other cells binding 25-1 Ab were also observed in total splenocytes obtained from BWF1 mice. </plain></SENT>
