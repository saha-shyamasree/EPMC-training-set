</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Colonizing bacteria interacting with the immature human intestine, unlike the mature intestine, favors inflammation over homeostasis [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As a result ten percent of premature infants develop an inflammatory necrosis of the intestine after birth, a condition known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>NEC is a major health problem in this patient population causing extensive morbidity and mortality and an enormous expenditure of health care dollars [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Yet certain commensal bacteria used as probiotics, when given to newborn prematures can prevent or lessen the severity of NEC [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="?"><plain>What is it about the immature intestine interacting with colonizing bacteria that causes this paradoxical response? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that commensal bacteria interacting with immature enterocytes can result in either an excessive inflammatory response or an inhibition of inflammation depending on the composition of the immature signaling pathways in the enterocyte. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Support for this hypothesis, as published data, exists from this laboratory [1,4,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We have identified that the genes responsible for the innate immune response pathway, e.g., NFκB, IL-8, IL-6, and their negative regulators (SIGRR, IRAK-M, A20, etc.) are either increased (NFκB, IL-8, IL-6) or decreased (negative regulators SIGRR, IRAK-M, A20, etc.) developmentally causing an aberrant response to these bacteria [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that a secreted factor from Bifidobacterium infantis (a probiotic preventative of NEC) preferentially downregulates an IL-1β inflammatory stimulus in fetal enterocytes [4,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that immature enterocytes interacting with commensal bacteria or their secretions have unique inflammatory or anti-inflammatory pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In fullterm neonates, an appropriate initial bacterial colonization of the intestine is necessary for normal development of immune defense leading to homeostasis [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Optimal colonization occurs when a full term infant is born vaginally, receiving maternal vaginal/colonic microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The initial bolus of maternal microbiota is further stimulated by oligosaccharides and other active factors (pIgA, lactoferrin, etc.) in breast milk which activate proliferation of so called “pioneer” bacteria, essential for stimulus of gut development [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Such “pioneer” bacteria isolated from newborn gut have been shown to stimulate the development of sIgA production [14] and to reduce excessive intestinal inflammation [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>One such “pioneer” bacterium noted in infant intestine early in life is Bacteroides fragilis [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This bacterium expresses on its surface a polysaccharide (PSA) which has been shown to affect the development of immune function [14] in macrophages and dendritic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Polysaccharide A (PSA) creates a balanced TH1/TH2 helper cell response which may prevent the development of allergy [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>PSA also interacts with TLR2 receptor molecules on CD4 lymphocytes to preferentially stimulate T-regulatory cells to produce IL-10 [16] which prevents experimental induced colitis via IL-17 stimulation [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To date no studies have examined the effect B. fragilis PSA on enterocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since this organism appears early in the newborn intestine and is anti-inflammatory, we studied its effect on fetal human enterocytes as a possible basis for prevention of NEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used ex vivo models of human fetal and NEC intestine and fetal mouse intestine to determine the mechanisms of B. fragilis PSA inhibition of IL-1β stimulated inflammation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This laboratory has had a long standing interest in the interaction between colonizing bacteria and the developing human intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We have shown that colonizing bacteria interacting with the premature human intestine preferentially stimulates inflammation over immune homeostasis [1,2,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We have also reported that the stimulation by certain bacteria can mediate excessive inflammation through activation of immature innate immune inflammatory response genes in fetal enterocytes [8,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Yet, there are also clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that probiotics and their secretions may also have a protective effect against this enhanced inflammatory response [6,25] suggesting a paradoxical situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This observation may be important clinically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>A major intestinal inflammatory condition, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), occurs commonly in premature infants less than 1500 gms [3,10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>NEC is associated with multiple risk factors after premature birth including hypoxic-ischemic events, the use of formula feeding, and a dysbiotic bacterial colonization resulting in an increased likelihood of severe intestinal inflammation, coagulation necrosis and gastrointestinal bleeding [3,5,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We believe that a major pathogenic mechanism of NEC is the accentuated response of the immature intestine to colonizing bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Yet paradoxically a major probiotic which has been shown clinically to protect against the expression of NEC is Bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis [4,8,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we have carefully studied the mechanism by which this probiotic and its secretions alter enterocyte inflammation in the immature human intestine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In that study, we focused on the effect of B. infantis secretions on the IL-1β-induced inflammatory response in premature human enterocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>IL-1β is an important inflammatory cytokine associated with the pathogenesis of NEC and functions by mediating inflammatory cell recruitment and amplifying the innate immune response via enterocyte signaling [26,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The gut is colonized with trillions of beneficial commensal microorganisms which normally maintain a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>To maintain intestinal homeostasis, both IEC and gut associated immune cells recognize bacterial components via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to conserve a balance between tolerance to the large communities of resident luminal bacteria while at the same time being able to mount an inflammatory response against pathogens [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>TLRs are a major class of PRRs that are present on IECs and mucosal immune cells which are involved in the induction of both tolerance and inflammation [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>TLR2 and TLR4 are two of 10 or more members of the TLR family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In recent studies with B. fragilis expressing PSA and with PSA alone, TLR2 had been implicated in the interaction with CD4 lymphocytes and dendritic cells [16,17]. B. fragilis with PSA has been identified during the first week of life in intestinal contents of full term, vaginally delivered human infants, particularly when the infant was exclusively breast fed [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This study is an initial in vitro attempt to identify with another so called “pioneer” colonizing bacterium, B. fragilis, if additional anti-inflammatory effects occur in a fetal intestinal cell line after inflammatory stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This so called “pioneer” microorganism has been implicated in reducing the tendency for intestinal inflammation in infant intestine in the first month of life [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Experimentally, B. fragilis containing PSA and PSA alone when given to germ free mouse models stimulate a balance between TH1 and TH2 CD4 lymphocytes, a step thought to be necessary in developing of immune homeostasis and preventing the increased expression of allergic disease seen in developed countries [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>TLR2 has been specifically implicated in the stimulation of FOXP3+ Tregs cells to produce IL-10 which leads to the suppression of the release of IL-17 cytokines implemented in intestinal inflammation [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In recent studies, we have shown that secretions from Bifidobacteria infantis, another “pioneer” bacteria, can mediate IL-1β-induced anti-inflammation in fetal intestine via the TLR4 receptor [11], suggesting that increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on the immature intestinal surface may help to mediate anti-inflammation from these “pioneer” neonatal bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, no studies have been done to determine the role of the “pioneer” expressed microorganism Bacteroides fragilis in preventing excessive enterocyte inflammation in human immature intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, using established ex vivo human fetal intestinal models developed in this laboratory, we started to determine the effect of PSA on Bacteroides fragilis an initial in vitro study using a fetal intestinal primary cell line and primary enterocytes isolated from NEC intestinal resection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that fetal human intestine favors excessive inflammation over anti-inflammation [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>We have also reported that conventional commensal bacteria can trigger intestinal inflammation in fetal but not mature intestinal enterocytes, presumably due to expression of immature innate immune inflammatory response genes [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Yet premature infants can be protected from the severe intestinal inflammation of NEC by commensals acting as probiotics [6,7,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This paradoxical response to colonizing bacteria by fetal intestine was recently underscored by our published observation that secretions from another “pioneer” bacterium (Bacteroides infantis) can reduce intestinal inflammation after an IL-1β inflammatory stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as stated this anti-inflammatory response by B. infantis secretions is mediated through the TLR4 receptor [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This observation represents an unconventional function for the TLR4 receptor and suggests that toll receptors in the immature intestine may exhibit different functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, since the TLR2 receptor has been implicated in the function of B. fragilis PSA and the development of immune homeostasis, particularly anti-inflammation of lymphocyte cells during the newborn period and B. infantis mediates anti-inflammation through the TLR4 receptor, we have investigated the role of B. fragilis PSA in excessive inflammation by fetal human enterocytes and have begun to determine the role of TLR2 and TLR4in this process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have used a human fetal small intestinal epithelial cell line (H4 cells) and knocked down its TLR2 and TLR4 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The cells were then pretreated with or without PSA and stimulated with IL-1β before measuring IL-8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The results showed that B. fragilis with PSA and PSA alone prevented IL-8 induction in response to IL-1β in control but not in TLR2 and TLR4 gene knockdown cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that both TLR2 and TLR4 are participants in the B. fragilis PSA effect in the prevention of the IL-8 inflammatory response in immature H4 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated a similar PSA anti-inflammatory effect in NEC-IEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>To confirm these results, we extended these observations to an in vivo fetal mouse model by applying similar conditions to embryo 18.5 day (E 18.5) fetal small intestinal organ cultures [11] from control, TLR4-/- and TLR2-/- mouse strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>PSA attenuated IL-8 induction in response to IL-1β in control but not in TLR2-/- and TLR4-/-mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PSA requires both the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors to prevent or attenuate IL-1β—induced IL-8 activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Although the underlying mechanism for anti-inflammation via both TLR2 and TLR4 is not known, we do know that PSA is a zwitterion with both positive and negative charges expressed on the molecule [20,33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>We also know that TLR2 and TLR4 can interact with both positive and negative charged molecules [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, electrostatic interaction with surface molecules, e.g., TLRs on the fetal enterocyte may contribute to a decrease in signals that mediate the IL-8 response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed however to establish the actual mechanism, particularly for the TLR4 receptor. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of AP-1 in probiotic prevention of IL-1β-induced IL-8 in H4 cells, we used TLR2 and TLR4 gene knocked down cells and pretreated these cells with or without PSA before stimulation with IL-1β. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This study shows for the first time that Bacteroides fragilis with PSA and PSA alone has an anti-inflammatory effect on IL-1β stimulation of IL-8 in fetal human enterocytes, NEC enterocytes and fetal mouse small intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>This anti-inflammation is both TLR2 and TLR4 dependent and mediated in part through a down regulation of P-c-Jun and P-c-Fos of the AP1 (TLR2 response), a developmentally-regulated transcription factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>This in vitro study represents an initial step in defining the role of B. fragilis PSA in anti-inflammation in the premature intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Before recommendations can be made for clinical use of this “pioneer” bacterium, the observation needs to be repeated in a mouse NEC model and decreased inflammation demonstrated after B. fragilis PSA and mutant non PSA (not demonstrated) strands have been studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In addition, we plan to confirm these results of this organism’s effect in TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- premature neonates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Since B. fragilis with PSA is a “pioneer” bacterium seen in the neonatal intestine, particularly with breastfeeding, this observation provides a further basis for promoting use of expressed breastmilk in premature infants, a known preventative measure to prevent NEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In future studies, PSA could also be used in a clinical trial as a “pioneer” bacterial product for premature infants to prevent NEC. </plain></SENT>
