</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are two main signalling molecules within eukaryotic cells which, through their interactions with different effector proteins, play central roles in regulating diverse cellular processes [1–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main source of DAG in cells is via the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by the enzyme phospholipase C in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli including growth factors and hormones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The DAG produced serves as a substrate for the enzyme DAG kinase (DGK), which phosphorylates it into PA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Due to the ability of DGK to convert one important signalling molecule (DAG) into another (PA), the activity of DGK in different cells is tightly controlled for maintenance of normal physiological conditions [1–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because DGK plays an important role in controlling diverse cellular processes including development, cell division and proliferation, neuronal and immune responses, vascular traffic, apoptosis, cytoskeletal reorganization, etc. multiples forms of DGK are generally found in most eukaryotic organisms [1–10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In mammalian species, where the DGK family of proteins has been best studied, 10 different isozymes of DGK, designated as α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι and κ, differing in their biochemical properties, tissue distributions, as well as their lengths (ranging from 567 aa to &gt;1150 aa) have been identified [1–6,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence similarities between these isozymes and the presence or absence of specific functional domains, the known DGK members have been grouped into 5 different classes or Types (Fig 1) [1–6,11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>All of these isozymes share in common a large catalytic domain, which is sometimes divided into two parts–catalytic and accessory domains, and 2 or 3 cysteine-rich domains, referred to as the C1 domains [reviewed in[1–6,12,13]]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The simplest and shortest (567 aa) of these isozymes is DGK-ε, sole member of the class III DGK, which contains only the commonly shared catalytic domain and the two C1 domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In addition, DGK-ε also contains a conserved helical segment near its N-terminal end that is indicated to play an important role in its membrane interaction [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The class I DGKs (α, β and γ isozymes), in addition to containing the commonly shared domains, are characterized by the presence of two EF-hand motifs and a conserved domain of unknown function near the N-terminal end [1–6,11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Novel characteristics of the class II DGK isozymes (δ, η and κ isoforms) include the presence of a plecstrin homology (PH) domain, a sterile α motif (SAM) domain and a large insert within the catalytic domain separating it into two parts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The class IV DGKs (ζ and ι isoforms) are distinguished from the others due to their containing a sequence homologous to the MARCKS phosphorylation site domain and four ankyrin repeats near the C-terminal end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Lastly, DGK-θ is the sole member of the class V DGK and it contains three C1 domains, a Gly-Pro rich domain and a PH-domain-like region with overlapping RAS-associating domain [1–6,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The unique domains present in DGK isozymes, through their interactions with various regulatory proteins and other molecules present in different cells and tissues, play key roles in the diverse physiological functions exhibited by different DGK isozymes [1–6]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence alignments of DGK homologs from representatives of different groups of vertebrates, conserved regions from the catalytic domain which could be properly aligned amongst different DGK classes were identified and these were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In the tree shown in Fig 2, while the distinction between different DGK classes was strongly supported, the nodes connecting these classes had low bootstrap scores indicating that the evolutionary relationships among different DGK classes were not reliably resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Thus, other molecular sequence based approaches which can provide insights are needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Conserved signature indels (CSIs) represent an important class of molecular markers that have been used in the past to resolve a number of important evolutionary questions [21,24–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The CSIs that are useful for evolutionary studies are generally of fixed lengths, present at specific positions iparticular genes/proteins, and they are flanked on both sides by conserved regions to ensure that they constitute reliable characteristics [21,25,27,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The CSIs in genes/proteins sequences generally result from rare genetic changes and the most parsimonious explanation to account for their shared presence in a given gene or protein from a specific group of species is that the genetic change giving rise to the CSI occurred in a common ancestor of the indicated group and then it was vertically inherited by the other group members [21,22,25,29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Due to the discrete natures of the CSIs and the fact that they are located within conserved regions,their presence or absence in different lineages or proteins is generally not affected by factors such as differences in evolutionary rates among different species, or proteins, and long-branch attraction artefacts [21,24–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We have examined the sequence alignment of catalytic domains from DGK homologs for the presence of CSIs and these analyses have identified a number of useful CSIs that are specifically shared by particular groups of DGK isozymes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>When a conserved indel is present in a given protein, to infer whether the observed indel is an insert or a deletion, information for the presence or absence of the indel in the ancestral state of the protein is needed [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In most cases, such information could be obtained by determining the presence or absence of the indel in species which are ancestral to those containing the indel [25,27,28,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In some instances, if two proteins have evolved by an ancient gene duplication event, then the presence or absence of the indel in the other protein has also proven useful to infer whether the observed indel is an insert or a deletion [25,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>However, due to the uniqueness of the DGK catalytic domain sequence for the eukaryotic homologs, no suitable outgroup is available for determining the ancestral state of the protein or reliably inferring whether a given CSI represents an insertion within a certain class of DGK homologs or a deletion in the rest of the DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Hence, our use of the term insert(s) or deletion(s) to describe the identified CSIs is only in reference to the presence or absence of the same or similar sequence characteristics in other classes of DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it should also be acknowledged that while the presence or absence of a CSI within a given conserved region can be reliably identified (due to the sequence conservation of flanking regions), it is often difficult to specify the exact location of the CSI within a conserved region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>This is especially true when the sequences of different taxa or homologs that are being compared differ considerably from each other and there is no structural information available for the proteins to guide the sequence alignments for correct placement of the CSI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Due to this limitation, the positions of various CSIs in the sequence alignment shown here represent their most likely positions based on our judgement of the sequence conservation of the flanking regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the optimal alignment that could be supported by other data the actual positions of some of these CSIs might be shifted by a few residues either to the left or on the right. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Information regarding the characteristics of various CSIs that have been identified by our analysis is provided below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The first of the identified CSIs within the catalytic domain is a 16–24 aa insert (marked signature ❶ in Fig 3) that is uniquely found in all of the Class I DGK homologs from different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The observed CSI is present in a conserved region near the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain and its shared presence by all DGK -α, -β and -γ homologs provides further evidence of the close and specific relationship among these isozymes belonging to class I DGKs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>For DGK-α and DGK-γ, interesting differences are also seen in the length of this CSI amongst the vertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>For DGK-α, in contrast to the fishes (e.g. Pundamila nyererei and Maylinda zebra), homologs found in mammals (e.g. humans, Rattus novergicus), birds (Serinus canaria) and amphibians (Xenopus tropocalis) are 6 aa longer, suggesting that an additional insert within the DGK-α likely occurred in a common ancestor of the latter groups of vertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Similarly, for DGK-γ, the birds and reptiles harbor a longer insert in contrast to that present in mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the homologs for DGK-γ were not detected in fishes and amphibian species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In addition to the CSI shown in Fig 3, DGK homologs contain one additional 2 aa conserved insert (marked Sig ❷A in Fig 4), which is also commonly shared by the class I DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>These signatures serve to distinguish the Class I and Class IV DGK homologs from all others and the presence of the inserts in the same position only in these two classes of homologs suggests that they may be more closely related to each other than to the other DGK classes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Most vertebrate species contain 10 different DGK isozymes which are grouped into 5 different classes or types (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>The DGKs from different classes are distinguished from each other by the presence or absence of specific functional domains; however, all of them share a large catalytic domain (CD), as well as two cysteine-rich domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In the simplest of the DGK isozymes, DGK-ε (sole member of class III DGK), the catalytic domain (&gt; 300 aa) makes up nearly 60% of the entire protein and thus it comprises the single largest sequence element specific for the DGK family of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the cysteine-rich C1 domains are of short lengths (~ 50 aa), show considerable sequence variation, and they are also present in numerous other proteins including the protein kinase C family of proteins [2–4,12,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Due to the prominence and uniqueness of the catalytic domain for the DGK family of proteins, analysis of its sequence provides an important resource for gaining an understanding of the evolution of this protein family as well as functional differences among its members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Our analyses of the catalytic domain sequences presented here have identified many novel sequence features that are specific for different types of DGKs and provide useful insights into the evolution of this protein family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>In a phylogenetic tree based on CD sequences, DGK homologs belonging to different classes formed strongly supported clusters, which were separated by long branches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>The observed results indicate strongly that apart from the other known differences in different types of DGK homologs (see [1–6]) their catalytic domain sequences have also diverged considerably from each other and provide clear distinction among different types of DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the DGK isozymes within each DGK class were tightly clustered in the phylogenetic tree indicating that their catalytic domain sequences are very similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>A major focus of the present work was on identifying novel sequence features within the CD, which are specific for either a particular type of DGK homologs or which are commonly shared by members of different DGK classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>A large number of sequence motifs or signatures, in the forms of CSIs, have been identified in the present work and a summary of the identified CSIs, their DGK class specificity and location within the catalytic domain is provided in Fig 8. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>For class I, class III, class IV and class V DGK homologs, multiple CSIs specific for these groups were identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The described signatures are uniquely present in all members of the indicated classes from vertebrate species (the main focus of the present work) indicating that the genetic changes responsible for these CSIs first occurred in the ancestors of specific DGK isoforms, and they were then retained in the descendent species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Further, according to the definition of the CSI(s) used in our work, the large insert (&gt;300 aa) within the class II DGK members [2–6,12], also represents a CSI (marked as Sig ❼) specific for the class II DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The sequence region in the CD where this large CSI is found in class II homologs, it is flanked on both sides by several residues that are conserved in all DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Within this conserved region, CSIs of specific lengths (Sig ❻, ❽ and ❽A) which are distinctive characteristics of the other classes of DGK homologs are also found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Based on the differences in the lengths of the CSIs in different classes of DGK homologs, this region is predicted to specify important functional differences in the properties of different classes of DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Another noteworthy CSI within the CD is a 16–24 aa insert (Sig ❶ in Fig 3) that is uniquely found in all of the Class I DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Some of the identified CSIs were also commonly shared by members from two different DGK types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>For example, the CSI in Sig ❹ (Fig 5) is commonly shared by class I and IV, and also possibly class V (Sig ❺), DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>A closer relationship between class I and IV homologs is also suggested by Sig❷A, B, where inserts that are either 2 aa or 4 aa long are specifically present in these two classes of DGK homologs and by the observed branching pattern of these homologs in the phylogenetic tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>In another instance (Sig❿A, B), CSIs of different lengths (3 aa and 4 aa) in the same position are a uniquely present in theε- and θ- classes of DGK-homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Different lengths of CSIs in the same position in specific classes of DGK homologs can results from several possibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>First, it is possible that independent genetic changes have occurred in the ancestor(s) of specific DGK classes, giving rise to CSIs of different lengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>However, in some cases such as Sig❷A, B (and also Sig❿A, B), it is also possible that initially a genetic change leading to either 2 aa or 4 aa insert occurred in a common ancestor of the class I and IV DGK homologs, and then another insertion or deletion event occurred in the same position in the ancestor of one of these two groups leading to the observed differences in the lengths of the CSIs in these two classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Although it is difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities, the fact that the class I and class IV DGK homologs also contain another uniquely shared CSI (viz. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Sig❹) and they branch together in the phylogenetic tree corroborate the view that the homologs from these two classes are closely related and that the CSI ❷A,B initially occurred in a common ancestor of these two classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>There is limited understanding at present concerning the overall function of the catalytic domain for eukaryotic DGKs [1–5,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Some differences have been recently reported in the activities of different classes of DGKs towards 1-monoacylglycerol and 2-monoacylglycerol [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>The catalytic domain contains a highly-conserved sequence motif (G-X-G-X-X-G) similar to that present in the ATP-binding sites of other protein kinases [2,31,32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>The importance of this motif for the functioning of DGKs has been established by mutational studies [2,31,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>The CDs from DGK-ε, -ζ, and -θ proteins exhibit very little DGK activity when expressed as isolated subunits [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>This and other observations have led to the suggestion that the proper functioning of the CD for mammalian DGKs requires interactions with other motifs (proteins) [1–5,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>However, our knowledge of the sequence motifs in the CD that may facilitate its interactions with other proteins/effectors molecules, and how different DGK isozymes, or classes of isozymes, differ in this regard is very limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>The lack of structural information for the CD for eukaryotic DGKs is also a major hindrance in understanding its function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>In this context, our identification of multiples CSIs within the CD that are specific for different classes of DGK homologs is of much interest and significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>Based on earlier work, the CSIs in protein sequences are known to play important functional roles in the organisms in which they are found [38–42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>The mutational changes in the CSIs affect proper functioning of the proteins as well as cell growth, and both large and small CSIs are indicated to be significant in this regard [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Further, extensive work on CSIs show that they are generally located in protein structures in surface loops [39,42–45], which are indicated to play important roles in mediating protein-protein interactions [39,44,46–49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, it can be hypothesized (predicted) that the CSIs in the CD that are specific for different classes of DGK homologs should also be playing important roles in the interactions of different DGK isozymes with specific proteins (or other target molecules) that may be responsible for the differences in the cellular functions of the different DGK isozymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Thus, further studies on understanding the cellular functions of the identified CSIs, and the specific interactions that they may be involved in, could provide important insights regarding the biochemical basis of the differences in the functions of different DGK isozymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>It should also be noted that apart from the CSIs that are specific for different classes of DGKs, sequence alignments shown in Figs 2–7 and S1 Fig also contain large numbers of specific amino acid substitutions (or polymorphisms) that are specific for particular classes of DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>These sequence polymorphisms constitute another type of molecular signature, which are also expected to be of functional significance [12,38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>The DGK family of proteins, due to their key roles in controlling the cellular concentrations of two important signalling molecules and thereby controlling diverse cellular processes, are targets for development of novel therapeutics for treatment of cancer, neuronal, metabolic and inflammatory diseases [9,50–57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>In this context, the CSIs identified in the present work, which are specific for different classes of DGK homologs and predicted to play important roles in the cellular functions of these isoforms, thus provide potentially useful drug targets [58]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>The DGK isozymes are primarily found in eukaryotic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Although a protein exhibiting DGK activity is present in many bacteria [4,5,59,60], it shows minimal similarity (15–18%) over a short length, and with multiple intervening gaps, to the eukaryotic DGKs [13] [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>The bacterial DGK homologs are short in comparison to the eukaryotic proteins and they do not contain any of the canonical sequence features (viz. catalytic domain and cysteine-rich C1 domains), which are shared characteristics of all eukaryotic DGK homologs [2,4,5,12,59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>These observations strongly suggest that the bacterial DGK homologs are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts, and that the proteins exhibiting DGK activity have evolved independently in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>In view of the importance of DGK isozymes in cellular signalling processes and their involvement in a wide variety of cellular functions, it is of much interest to know how this large family of proteins has evolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic approach employed in this work was able to clearly distinguish the five different classes of DGKs; however, as the canonical DGK homologs are only found in eukaryotic organisms, it was difficult to root the tree and determine how members of different DGK classes are related to each other and which of these DGK isozymes is ancestral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The CSIs in protein sequences provide another useful means for understanding the evolutionary relationships among distantly related species; however, in the present instance, due to the absence of a suitable outgroup, it was difficult to establish the ancestral state of the DGK protein sequence and reliably infer whether the observed CSIs are insertions or deletions in the indicated classes of DGK homologs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Although the present work does not resolve how different classes of DGK proteins have originated from a common ancestor and which of these isoforms is most ancestral, the results presented here show that of the different classes of DGKs, the DGK-ε, -θ and -ζ isoforms are most widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>In addition to their nearly ubiquitous presence in vertebrate species, the homologs for these isoforms are also indicated to be present in most invertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>In contrast, homologs for the other DGK isozymes were not detected in a number of invertebrate phyla (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Although more detailed studies are needed to establish with certainty the identity of the DGK isoforms that are present in deep branching eukaryotic phyla, the observed broader distribution of the DGK-ε, DGK-θ and DGK-ζ isoforms within eukaryotic organisms suggests that one of these isoforms likely represent the ancestral form of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Of these isoforms, DGK-ε represents the most rudimentary form of the protein containing all of the main sequence features that are commonly shared by all other DGK family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Further, DGK-ε is the only isoform which shows specificity for a particular substrate i.e. arachidonoyl-containing diacylglycerol [2,3,6,12,62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that the DGK-ε originated first, and all other DGK isoforms originated from it by acquisition of different domains and other identified signatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>However, the present study is based only on the analyses of the catalytic domain sequences and further work on the analyses of other sequence regions of the DGK protein family could provide additional useful information to clarify the relationships among different DGK isoforms. </plain></SENT>
