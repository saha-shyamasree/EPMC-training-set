</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breast cancer risk increases dramatically in women carrying mutations in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, most frequently BRCA1 or BRCA2 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depending on the type of mutation and the presence of genetic modifiers, this risk can increase to more than 80% [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mammary gland architecture is dynamic and changes during puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution post partum and post menopause [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At puberty, the mouse mammary ductal system starts growing from the nipple to fill up the mammary fat pad at the age of 3-12 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The epithelial lining consists of luminal cells that produce milk, and myoepithelial cells that are responsible for contraction during lactation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Different theories regarding the mammary stem cell exist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One model proposes the existence of basal stem cells with the property of generating both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Another hypothesis is that luminal and basal/myoepithelial are generated by a committed lineage-restricted progenitor cell [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although controversy still surrounds the field, current evidence points to a scenario whereby a luminal progenitor may be at the origin of basal-like BRCA-associated breast cancer [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment of BRCA1-associated breast cancer does not differ from other types of breast cancer, although targeted approaches are emerging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, because BRCA-deficient cells are unable to correct stalled DNA replication forks via homologous repair, these cells are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapeutics that arrest replication [11-15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, BRCA-deficient cells are more sensitive to poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition, which is involved in base excision repair [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have already tested the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of PARP with overall promising results [17-24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The only effective preventive options for BRCA mutation carriers are currently bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>PM yields a risk reducing effect of more than 90-100% in healthy BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers [25-27] and PBSO decreases breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers without prior breast cancer approximately by 50% [26, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An alternative and less invasive preventive strategy option is the use of hormonal therapy as chemo prevention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of estrogen receptor function decreases breast cancer risk in healthy BRCA2 mutation carriers, but not in BRCA1 mutation carriers [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, cancer-related mortality in BRCA mutation carriers may be managed through intensive surveillance using mammography and MRI, or biomarkers in nipple fluid like methylation [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Efficiency of this approach however is limited because of high breast tissue density in young women and the aggressive, fast developing nature of BRCA-associated breast tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Annual MRI detects the majority of breast cancers at an early and favorable stage [32, 33], but a drawback of MRI is the higher rate of false-positive results leading to biopsies of non-diseased tissue and distress [34-37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>An alternative and attractive way to prevent breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers may be the local administration of ablative agents to the mammary ductal system via the nipple. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies in which chemotherapeutics were used intraductally (ID), such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin, methotrexate, and paclitaxel, show promising results [38-40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>ID chemotherapy was also explored in phase I trials in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer prior to mastectomy, where ID administration of PLD and cisplatin was well tolerated with mild adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pathological changes could be found in the treated ducts [40-42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the efficacy and safety of ID cisplatin treatment as an alternative prophylactic therapy in the prevention of BRCA1-associated breast cancer formation, in combination with PARP-inhibition. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>ID cisplatin treatment leads to a uniform reduction of the epithelial mammary cells and thereby prolongs breast tumor-free latency in a conditional BRCA1-associated mouse model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>However, our results also show that the success rate of ID treatment using cisplatin is variable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Multiple functional assays, including whole mount and transplantation assays, resulted in a successful ablation in approximately half of the recipient mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This partial effect can be explained by e.g. incomplete injection penetrance, whereby not all ductal branches have been exposed to cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the progenitor cell leading to cancer is presumably a low proliferating cell and as such less susceptible to platinum-based drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Another explanation could be the that proliferative differences due to estrus cycling may influence the effectiveness of cisplatin [45, 46], which suggests that ID treatment should be tailored to specific estrus stages for successful cisplatin-based prophylaxis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, ID cisplatin prolonged tumor-free latency in untreated mammary glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Since Brca1 inactivation and subsequent tumor formation in the WAPcre-driven model occurs during the first estrus cycle (independent of pregnancy-induced WAP activation) [43], we anticipate that this is probably due to the fact that prior to treatment, WAPcre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F female mice contain Brca1-deficient mammary epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Also, because Brca-/- mouse embryonic stem cell lines are 5-fold more sensitive to cisplatin than Brca+/+ wild type cells [11], it is likely that Brca1 loss underpins the observed sensitivity to cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Although rapid systemic distribution of platinum drugs is evident after ID treatment (our data and [41]), we also showed that platinum levels in the circulation and untreated glands were lower than can be expected after systemic treatment [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>A study using intra tumor (IT) injection of cisplatin and found a comparable AUC to the value we found after ID injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Compared to IP injection, IT administration led to lower plasma concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Systemic exposure to platinum after IT injection was calculated to be 65-75% of the exposure after systemic administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Since IT and ID cisplatin administration showed a similar pharmacokinetic profile, we expect that also ID cisplatin will lead to lower systemic platinum levels compared to systemic treatment [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Our findings are in agreement with studies showing that ID treatment with other chemotherapeutics also leads to systemic exposure [39, 40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Long-term carcinogenicity is a major point of concern in prophylactic treatments using chemotherapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The same cytotoxic agent can be used to treat cancer, but can also drive carcinogenesis [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>ID PLD is reported to induce malignant mammary gland tumors in wild type mice after a follow-up of 42 weeks [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>When MMECs were isolated from mice treated with ID PLD, recipients developed tumors [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Our current study shows that cisplatin leads to tumor formation in 6.3% of treated mammary glands more than 95 weeks post treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The induction of late tumors also affected overall survival after cisplatin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The induction of secondary malignancies may be explained by platinum release from regenerating tissue leading to circulating plasma platinum levels up to 20 years after treatment [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Ovarian cancer survivors show an increased breast cancer risk, however the influence of chemotherapy was either not investigated or not convincingly shown [51, 52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Genetic and reproductive factors predisposing to ovarian cancer may also have contributed to breast cancer development [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our findings in mice, it was shown that long-term testicular and ovarian cancer survivors have no increased lung cancer risk [51-53], and testicular cancer patients treated with chemotherapy only do not develop more lung tumors during follow-up [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Despite the obvious species differences in rodents and humans that may underlie the long-term tumor formation after intraductal cisplatin in our used preclinical models, we think that ID administration of solvable cisplatin cannot upfront be regarded as a safe alternative to prevent BRCA-associated breast cancer in genetic carriers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Possible alternative ways of delivering an immobilized yet locally active chemotherapy should be developed to prevent systemic exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Since intraductal PLD also induced mammary tumors, we feel that this precludes the use of ID chemotherapy in general for preventive purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Using local therapy intraductally however seems to be feasible and effective and could be combined with the use of nanocarriers [55], liposomes [56], or antidotes [57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Olaparib was already shown to be effective in breast cancer treatment [17-21, 23, 24], but now we also demonstrate the prophylactic effect of systemic PARP-inhibition in Brca1-associated breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Combining ID cisplatin and olaparib led to an additional effect in breast tumor incidence compared to both monotherapies without increasing toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to investigate the optimal dosages of combination treatment and the long-term safety of olaparib treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrate that although ID treatment using cisplatin, especially in combination with PARP-inhibition successfully attenuates tumor formation in a clinically relevant mouse model of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, it leads to long-term local and systemic secondary malignancies in mice and may not be safe in humans. </plain></SENT>
