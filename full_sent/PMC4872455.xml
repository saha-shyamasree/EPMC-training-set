</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental disorders are an essential and poorly understood clinical challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complications they cause such as learning disorders, memory-formation deficits and epilepsy, have profound effects on patients' daily life.1, 2 Numerous gene mutations are involved in these pathologies, including genes associated with postsynaptic components.3, 4 Moreover, recent studies provide increasing evidence of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the underlying pathobiology,5 and mutations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation are found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.6, 7 In addition, recent report suggests that several histone-modification genes, including both histone methyltransferases and demethylases, are causative risk genes for such disorders.8 Nevertheless, our knowledge of the involvement of histone modifications in neurodevelopmental disorders is limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histone modification is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression through the modulation of chromatin structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An important histone-modification process is histone methylation and demethylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among the best understood and most essential classes of histone demethylases is the Jumonji family, first cloned by Takeuchi et al.9 in 1995, which was followed by the identification of the Jmjd2 family, a Jumonji family subgroup. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The JMJD2 family consists of 6 subtypes (JMJD2A-JMJD2F); JMJD2B acts as a transcriptional activator of targeted genes through demethylation of specific lysine residues on H3K9me3.10, 11 JMJD2B is located in the nucleus in dividing cells and has demethylase activity to H3K9me3.12 Previous research has mainly focused on the oncogenic potential of JMJD2B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In particular, overexpression of JMJD2B exhibits oncogenic activity in various human cancers, including prostate, breast, colon and gastric cancers.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 In addition, JMJD2B was found to be necessary for self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cell generation.18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The Jumonji family appears to also play important roles in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Two mutations of JMJD2B have been found in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) along with other histone demethylase enzymes, including JMJD1A and, JARID1B.8 In addition to these enzymes, mutations of other histone demethylase genes including KDM6A, which is implicated in Kabuki syndrome,19 and JARID1C, which is implicated in X-linked mental retardation syndrome,20 are found in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, histone demethylation appears to be critically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the function of the Jumonji family in the central nervous system (CNS) remains largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the function of JMJD2B in the CNS by generating neuron-specific, JMJD2B-deficient mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These mice exhibited various symptoms reminiscent of neurodevelopmental disorders, and impaired synaptic maturation in the hippocampus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that JMJD2B is required for neuronal circuit formation, and its deficiency leads to behavioral and physiologic abnormalities observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A previous report revealed that HDAC2, a histone modifier gene, affected spine number in hippocampus and regulated the formation of neural circuits.31 These findings prompted us to hypothesize that JMJD2B was associated with synaptic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>To assess this possibility, we examined the spine structure of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using the Golgi staining method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region receive direct and indirect excitatory inputs from various anatomical regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Schaffer collaterals from CA3 are one of the major inputs to CA1 and they terminate in the distal two-thirds of the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region.32 Therefore, we analyzed the spine morphology and density on secondary dendrites of the pyramidal neurons in this area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>We first counted the total number of spines per 20âÎ¼m dendrite and found a significant increase in the spine numbers in JMJD2B mutant mice (P=0.041; Figures 3aâd). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>We then performed structural analysis of spines, classifying them into mature spines (mushroom type) and immature spines (thin type, filopodia type and stubby type). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>We found that the number of mature mushroom type spines was significantly reduced in JMJD2B mutant mice (P=0.006), and that the number of immature filopodia type was increased (filopodia type; P=0.08; Figures 3aâc and e). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>As JMJD2B is expressed also in somatosensory cortex from late prenatal to early postnatal mouse, we analyzed the number and structure of spines in apical dendrite of layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron in somatosensory cortex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Notably, MeCP2 mutant mice, which display neurodevelopmental delay and spontaneous epileptiform activity, reveal increased number of spines in somatosensory cortex.33 However, we found no difference between the genotypes in either spine number or structure in somatosensory cortex (Supplementary Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>We next attempted to investigate the formation of dendrites in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, it was difficult to assess the length and elaboration of specific neurons, as the dendrites of Golgi-stained neurons overlapped with each other in the CA1 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cultured hippocampal neurons derived from P1 JMJD2B mutant mice and WT mice for 7 days, and assessed the formation of dendrites in vitro. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have revealed that neurodevelopmental disorders are sometimes correlated with intellectual disability.2 Therefore, we examined whether working memory was impaired in JMJD2B mutant mice as assessed by spontaneous alteration behavior in the Y-maze task. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>These results are in keeping with the aberrant neuronal morphology observed in JMJD2B mutant mice, as accumulating evidences indicate an association of memory function with alterations in dendritic spine morphology.35 Therefore, impaired hippocampal spine maturation may cause working memory deficits in JMJD2B mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some JMJD2B mutant mice showed spontaneous epileptiform-like activity (data not shown), which is another important symptom of neurodevelopmental disorders.1 It occurred following stressful events such as cage opening, handling or placement in a novel environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Seizures generally began at about 5âs after these events beginning with behavioral arrest and rigid motionless posture, followed by head and neck jerks, and clonus of forelimb and hindlimb. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the phenotype of JMJD2B mutant mice in brain development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>We found a decreased number of mature spines and increased number of immature spines, resulting in increased total number of spines in JMJD2B mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region partly transmit electrical signals to distal radial stratum of CA1 region through Schaffer collaterals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is intriguing to hypothesize that the abnormalities in spine number and structure in the CA1 region induce defective signal transmission from CA3 to CA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The expression level of PSD95 in hippocampus was not changed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This is presumably because the change in the PSD95 expression in the hippocampal spines was region-specific or the minute change could not be detected by using the western blot test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>JMJD2B mutant mice displayed spontaneous epileptiform-like activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Although it is possible that seizure recurrence can alter synapse connectivity leading to change in spine number and structure in JMJD2B mutant mice, this would not be the case considering the rare incidence rate and age of onset of seizures (we used 8-week-old mice for analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>A previous report suggests that JMJD2B is a causative risk gene for neurodevelopmental disorders,8 while accumulating evidence indicates that hippocampal spines in various mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorder are structurally and functionally abnormal.36, 37, 38, 39 For example, mice with a mutation in SHANK2, a risk gene for ASD, display an increased number of hippocampal spines and abnormal synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.37 Furthermore, high-density and spindle-shaped dendritic spines are also observed in the brains of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.40 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>We also observed behavioral alterations in JMJD2B-deficient mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations of a number of genes involved in epigenetic modification, including DNA methylation, histone acetylation or deacetylation, and histone methylation and demethylation, have been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Indeed, two mutations of JMJD2B were identified in ASD patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The results of open-field test suggest that JMJD2B-deficient mice are hyperactive at baseline and have trouble in becoming accustomed to a novel environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental disorders sometimes correlate with intellectual disability.2 JMJD2B-deficient mice did in fact display working memory deficits as determined by assessment of correct entry number in the Y-maze test (Figure 5c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these mice sometimes displayed epileptiform-like seizures, which are frequently observed in neurodevelopmental disorders.3 These mice also displayed anti-depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, we should be careful in the interpretation of this data, as this tendency may just reflect the heightened baseline hyperactivity of these mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, these mice did not display excessive anxiety-like or ASD-like behaviors, such as social interaction deficits or indifference to novel objects, or other abnormalities (PPI and rhythm tests). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Taken together these behavioral data indicate that JMJD2B mutant mice display attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like behavior with memory deficits and epilepsy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>However, JMJD2B is suspected to be a risk gene for ASD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>One possible reason for this discrepancy is that our behavioral tests may not be appropriate for the detection of ASD-like symptoms in this mouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>For example, several mouse models with mutated risk genes for ASD display abnormalities in ultrasonic vocalization, and this important behavioral characteristic in ASD-model mice was not tested in our study.41, 42 Although rearing behavior in mice is generally described as an index of exploratory behavior, increases in the frequency of rearing number observed in JMJD2B mutant mice may replicate repetitive behavior in ASD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In fact, recent reports have revealed that Shank3 mutant mice, a model of ASD, display enhanced rearing.43 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>JMJD2B is a histone lysine demethylase that acts as a transcriptional activator through demethylation of H3K9me3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the transcription of target genes is suppressed when JMJD2B is depleted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal spine formation, elimination and maturation are dynamic processes that maintain the synaptic network of the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Actin-binding proteins, postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and low-molecular-GTP-binding proteins have been reported to be important factors involved in these processes.44 Transcriptional silencing of such factors by JMJD2B depletion may alter their expression level, which may in turn underlie the increase in total spine number with a decrease in mature spines that we observed in the hippocampal CA1 region of JMJD2B mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>A previous report demonstrated that G9a histone methyltransferase elevates the density of dendritic spines in nucleus accumbens neurons by reducing H3K9me2 levels on exposure to cocaine.45 In addition, mutation of MeCP2, the causative gene of Rett syndrome and an epigenetic regulator that acts by binding to methylated DNA, also causes a decrease in the number of dendritic spines.46 Thus, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms affect the development and plasticity of dendritic spines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>A differential genome-wide expression study for JMJD2B-deficient ES cells reported that gene expression of several genes involved in synaptic function such as Homer2, Rhob and Rhog was changed.47, 48, 49 However, the expression level of these genes was not changed in hippocampus of JMJD2B mutant mice in our experimental paradigm (Supplementary Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to identify the target genes of JMJD2B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that the genes involved in the regulation of spine structure might not be direct targets of JMJD2B. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that various regions in the brain are affected in the neurodevelopmental disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>For example, pathological findings are observed in cerebral cortex, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum and hippocampus in neurodevelopmental disorders.50, 51 Most notably, abnormal neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex is associated with ASD-like behavior.52 Indeed, disorganization of the cerebral cortex is observed in children with ASD.53 JMJD2B, which is strongly expressed in the cerebral cortex at perinatal stages, might also play a role in cortical neurogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the deficiency of JMJD2B causes abnormal cerebral neurogenesis resulting in abnormal behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to examine whether the hippocampus is the region responsible for abnormal behavior in JMJD2B mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study elucidates the function of JMJD2B in the dendritic spine regulation and behavior, and provides a new mouse model for neurodevelopmental disorders. </plain></SENT>
