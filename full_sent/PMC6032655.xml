</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are the most frequent benign renal tumour, with a prevalence varying between 0.2% and 0.6% and a strong female predilection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They occur as sporadic, isolated entities in 80% of cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining 20% of AMLs develop in association with tuberosclerosis complex (TSC) or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AMLs are considered as a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Many types display different pathology, radiological features, and clinical behaviour, although they all consist of variable proportions of the same three elements: smooth muscle, blood vessels, and adipose tissue [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of renal AMLs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The detection of adipose tissue is the fundamental diagnostic criterion of a classic AML [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, a minority of AMLs lack visually detectable fat on imaging, making it harder to distinguish from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, accurate preoperative diagnosis of renal AMLs is critical to prevent unnecessary nephrectomies and preserve renal functions [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to provide a radiological classification of renal AML that contributes to the understanding and diagnosis of the different types and the appropriate therapeutic management and follow-up. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Clinical Classification </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>About 80% of AMLs present as isolated entities, most commonly manifesting in middle-aged women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>They tend to be single and small and rarely progress to cause significant morbidity [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the remainder 20% of cases, AMLs occur in association with TSC or, less commonly, as part of LAM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Relative to the sporadic form of AML, these hereditary lesions affect both genders equally and manifest at a younger age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>They are likely to be multiple, large, and bilateral, and are prone to grow and be more aggressive [357]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>AMLs are observed in approximately 75% of patients with TSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>TSC is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder characterized by the development of benign tumours (hamartomas) in multiple organs throughout the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The main organs involved are the brain, skin, lung, and kidney [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>TSC is caused by mutations in one of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These proteins interact with each other to form a tumour suppressor complex, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This pathway is important for angiogenesis, protein synthesis, and cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Defective or deficient TSC1 or TSC2 activity leads to unchecked activation of mTOR and formation of characteristic hamartomas [267]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>AMLs may also develop in patients with LAM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This rare disorder may occur sporadically, in the absence of other diseases, but is common in patients with TSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by diffuse interstitial proliferation of smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) and the presence of thin-walled cysts distributed throughout the lungs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These LAM cells have mutations in the same TSC1 and TSC2 genes [67]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Histological Classification </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Renal AML can be classified histologically as typical (triphasic) or atypical (monophasic or epithelioid) [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Most AMLs contain all three components, namely dilated blood vessels (angio), smooth muscle cells (myo), and mature adipocytes (lipo), in various proportions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>They are classified as triphasic tumours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, some tumours consist almost exclusively of one component, while other elements are present in very small amounts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>They are called monophasic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>At last, the epithelioid variant of AML contains numerous epithelioid muscle cells with abundant eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm and few or no fat cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These tumours have a tendency toward malignant transformation and can be locally aggressive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Histologically, they can resemble and be misdiagnosed as RCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, distinction of epithelioid AMLs from RCC is possible by the presence of immunohistochemistry markers, such as smooth muscle markers (caldesmon and smooth muscle actin) and melanocytic markers (HMB-45 antigen and melan-A) [2345]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Radiological Classification </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>There is a growing body of literature describing findings and techniques that may be used to distinguish renal AMLs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>A lack of a generally accepted and standardized terminology or classification of AML fuels the persisting confusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In this review, a radiological classification reported by two groups of authors will be discussed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A recent article hypothesized that renal AMLs can be classified according to CT and MRI findings using quantitative values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>They classified these tumours as fat-rich, fat-poor, or fat- invisible, based on the amount of fat detected on imaging studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To distinguish these different types, a region of interest (ROI) was placed in the most hypodense area of the lesion to measure the attenuation value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>A lesion was defined as fat-rich when the ROI measured â¤ â10 Hounsfield units (HU) on unenhanced CT (UECT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>However, UECT could not differentiate fat-poor from fat-invisible AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Therefore chemical shift imaging (CSI) MRI was introduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This modality provides a higher sensitivity for fat detection than UECT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>As in UECT, the most signal-dropped area was detected and a ROI was placed within. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>On CSI-MRI, fat-poor AML was characterized when the tumour-to-spleen ratio (TSR) was &lt; 0.71 or the signal intensity index (SII) was &gt; 16.5%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Because of too little fat, fat-invisible AML was defined having a TSR â¥ 0.71 and a SII â¤ 16.5% [910]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This classification showed an almost perfect inter-reader agreement, which means it is feasible for radiologists to apply in practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to understand that detection of the most hypodense area on CT or most signal-dropped area on MRI and placement of the ROI within is crucial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>A mislocation or inappropriate size of the ROI may change the type of AML, with misclassification and unwanted procedures as a result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Another disadvantage is the fact that different CT and MR scanners may produce different attenuation numbers and signal intensities, leading to a wrong classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>For example, if an AML is measured â9 HU at one CT scanner, it will be classified as fat-poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>However, if another scanner describes the lesion as â11 HU, it will be classified as fat-rich. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Although the difference of 2 HU is very minimal and probably insignificant, the management is completely different [910]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Another review article proposed a classification based on clinical, histologic, and imaging features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>First, the authors divided renal AMLs into sporadic and hereditary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Histologically, they classified sporadic AMLs into benign triphasic type and potentially malignant epithelioid type [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Benign triphasic type was further divided into fat-rich and fat-poor AML using imaging modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>While fat-rich AML contained enough fat to be detected on UECT (ROI â¤ â10 HU), fat-poor AML did not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Fat-poor AML was further classified into three subtypes, based on the amount and distribution of adipocytes within the lesion and other imaging features: hyperattenuating AML, isoattenuating AML, and AML with epithelial cysts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Hyperattenuating AML was hyperattenuating compared to renal parenchyma on UECT (&gt; 45 HU), homogeneously enhancing on contrast enhanced CT, and T2-hypointense on MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, isoattenuating AML was characterized by attenuation numbers close to renal parenchyma on UECT (between â10 and 45 HU). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>These lower attenuation levels were caused by the presence of fat cells, sufficient in quantity to lower the overall attenuation relative to hyperattenuating AMLs, but too few in one area to be detected on regular imaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Finally, AMLs with epithelial cysts could be distinguished by the presence of epithelial cysts, with the non-cystic parts appearing similar to hyperattenuating AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Radiological features of this rare subtype could not be fully described, due to the lack of data [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Epithelioid AMLs, that can be potentially malignant and metastasize, showed hyperattenuation on UECT, heterogeneously enhancement on contrast enhanced CT, and T2-hypointensity on MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>These findings were caused by the epithelioid muscle component and the intratumoral haemorrhage and necrosis [3410]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>There are limitations associated with the classification described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>First, the requirement of clinical and pathological information makes it difficult for radiologists to use in daily practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Second, there are problems in applying the imaging criteria for classifying isoattenuating AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The authors reported isoattenuating AML being an AML with attenuation values between â10 and 45 HU on UECT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>However, simple renal cysts have attenuation numbers ranging between â10 and 10 and appear definitely hypoattenuating, while renal masses measuring &gt; 40 HU frequently appear hyperattenuating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>So, because of the wide range of AML attenuation values, âisoattenuating AMLâ does not seem to be an appropriate term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors did not suggest a quantitative threshold for CSI-MRI, which means that radiologists cannot classify AML using TSR or SII [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the classification first described is the most easily applicable in practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Radiologists can categorize renal AMLs as fat-rich, fat-poor, and fat-invisible, according to the amount of fat detected on UECT or CSI-MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>However, attention should be paid to fit the ROI within the right area of the fat tissue, otherwise many fat-rich or fat-poor AMLs may be misclassified as fat-poor or fat-invisible. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Most patients are asymptomatic when they receive the diagnosis of an AML [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic presentation is most frequently related to spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage, although this is seen in less than 15% of cases [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>This may lead to shock in one-third of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Therefore, risk of a life-threatening bleeding is the main clinical concern in a patient diagnosed with AML. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the benign prognosis of classic renal AMLs, the epithelioid variant may undergo malignant transformation, although this is rare. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In TSC and LAM, the disease process tends to be more aggressive compared to the sporadic form. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In TSC, hamartomas are formed in multiple organs throughout the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, some fat-rich AMLs contain very small areas of fat, which may not be recognized at CT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the acquisition of thin slice sections (1.5â3.0 mm) and obtaining attenuation measurements using small ROIs or even pixel values may be needed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In fat-poor AMLs, UECT cannot show a hypoattenuating area measuring less than â10 HU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The attenuation values of such lesions range widely, according to the size or location of a ROI: when a ROI is placed in a region of muscle cells and vessels, the lesion attenuation will be higher than when a ROI is placed in an area that consists mostly of fat cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>For this reason, fat-poor AMLs are heterogeneously isoattenuating or hyperattenuating. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Renal AML is the most prevalent benign neoplasm of the kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>It has a variable and heterogeneous nature, with the potential to pose serious diagnostic challenges in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of classic AMLs are well described, but the radiological distinction between non-classic AMLs and RCCs continues to be difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the different types, their classification, and their radiologic appearance will help radiologists in making a correct diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>When an AML is considered in the differential diagnosis of a renal lesion that does not demonstrate classical features, confirmatory imaging, percutaneous renal biopsy, or surgical excision should be performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Several invasive, non-invasive, and pharmacologic treatment options exist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Careful surveillance before and after treatment is necessary, particularly for patients with TSC or LAM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Without proper management, renal AML may have serious consequences. </plain></SENT>
