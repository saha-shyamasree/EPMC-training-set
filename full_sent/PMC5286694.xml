</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Triatominae are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Out of the more than 152 species reported in this subfamily, a few are closely adapted to human structures and represent the main vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is admitted however, that all the species are potential vectors, some of them becoming today more important after the elimination of the main vectors during various international campaigns [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Ecuador, sixteen species of the Triatominae have been reported, distributed in 20 of the 24 provinces [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The main vectors of the country are Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Triatoma dimidiata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Other species, belonging to the genera Triatoma or Panstrongylus, are considered to be secondary vectors [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Triatomine eggs are oval or elliptical, slightly asymmetrical and present a smooth convex or ornamented operculum [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Eggs have received much attention regarding insecticide sensibility [8–10] or physiology [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Systematic studies on the Triatominae were mainly focused on adults and nymphs, and less frequently on eggs [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For species [14–22], or population characterization [23–25], egg morphology has been examined mainly on the basis of qualitative characters such as color pattern and structural characteristic (form, texture of shell and operculum, exochorial architecture). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Except for a recent study comparing the chorial rim and the collar of the eggs between various species of Rhodnius [19], the morphometric studies always relied on traditional techniques [13, 15, 18, 20, 22–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The main problem for the study of elliptical structures (e.g. eggs) through traditional techniques is the difficulty and ambiguity to locate maximum or minimum part of curvature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The modern morphometrics allows a direct description of the contour, separating size and shape, with the additional possibility to visualize shape changes among groups [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Frequently, the morphology of the eggs of Triatominae considers separately the operculum and the remaining part of the egg [17, 22, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We thus separated the morphometric analysis of the operculum, performed according to the landmark-based method, and the analysis considering the complete egg (including the operculum), based on the outline-based morphometric approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>For a Triatominae species, the presence of eggs in the domicile could be related to the ability of this species to colonize human dwellings [30], suggesting its importance as a vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For this reason, it is relevant to develop egg-based species identification techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were (i) to apply the modern morphometric techniques for eggs characterization, and (ii) to test these techniques for species and population discrimination. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>For shape variable definition, we exclusively used the elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the observed contour is decomposed in terms of sine and cosine curves of successive frequencies called harmonics, and each harmonic is described by four coefficients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>With this method, the first harmonic ellipse parameters are used to normalize the elliptic Fourier (NEF) coefficients so that they are invariant to size, rotation, and the starting position of the outline trace. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>By doing this, the three first coefficients become constant (1, 0 and 0) and are not used in the remaining analyses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>For metric characters in general, there are many possible causes for size or shape variation between organisms [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>According to the literature available on insect eggs, one possible reason for shape changes could result from an artefact related to the position of the egg, or could be the effect of egg developmental age, or to some other parameters related to the mother and/or the environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The choice of the same stage of development for species comparisons was justified because the egg physiology suggests possible change of size during development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>For instance a possible shrinking of the egg volume could be expected because of yolk lipids consumption by the embryo, as shown in R. prolixus [43, 44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Chaves et al. [12] identified an increase of the maximum diameter of eggs during development, but Hinton [45] and Beament [46] showed that the size of the egg was reduced because of water loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In their study, Chaves et al. [12] suspected the eggs could have been mishandled so that the final diameter increase could be spurious data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We discarded this possible source of artefact by gluing the eggs in the same position when examining the possible changes during development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The difference of shape we found between development stages could appear as a difficulty for studying eggs since it means that eggs should be selected for their age before comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>However, the simple criterion of visible eye-spots in the anterior part of the egg (Fig. 4), as used here for T. carrioni, is valid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>To avoid possible data heterogeneity, we recommend however to try comparing eggs at a similar developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The physiological status of females could influence also some traits of their eggs [11, 47], a possible effect which was taken in account here by comparing eggs coming from newly-molted females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>By comparing laboratory lines reared under the same conditions, fed with the same source of blood at the same frequency, using eggs at similar developmental stages and positions, we could reduce the possible environmental influence on egg shape variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The clear-cut differences found between some groups, especially between species, are thus unlikely to be artefactual or circumstantial differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Panstrongylus chinai and P. howardi are controversial species [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>However, they were almost perfectly separated (96%) by the shape of the egg, and weakly (74%) separated by the shape of the operculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>As an additional argument for diverging forms, they showed no parallelism between the respective sizes of the egg body and the operculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This level of divergence was in contrast with a recent morphometric study of the head and wings showing relatively low morphometric and cytogenetic differences, compatible with geographical variation (Additional file 1: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The difference of egg shape could perhaps be attributed to the restricted spatial and temporal sampling of P. howardi: their eggs were collected from a single community and on the same day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, our P. howardi sample could provide a truncated representativeness of the species variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The other reason for the clear-cut difference as disclosed between P. howardi and P. chinai could be, however, true evolutionary difference. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In addition to species discrimination, the egg shape disclosed consistent differences between allopatric populations of R. ecuadoriensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the variation observed in the geometry of their wings, suggesting some genetic drift due to geographical isolation, not excluding environmental effects due, for instance, to different hosts or different climates [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The level of differences between these two geographic populations was striking: the Mahalanobis distances as based on the egg contour (6.5) were larger than between species of the Triatomini (6.3), and larger also (2.4 versus 1.8) when based on the operculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the reclassification scores were comparable (egg contour) as, or higher (operculum) than, the ones obtained between species of the Triatomini. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in spite of living in a warmer climate and at a lower altitude, the Manabí specimens tended to be larger, which contradicts the Bergmann’s rule and could suggest genetic divergence [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>However, the Bergmann’s rule argument is difficult to consider between populations located close to the equatorial line [51]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The geometric morphometrics applied to the eggs - contrary to the one applied to the wing venation of insects - is still in its infancy, and, due to its promising features, more studies are expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>An obstacle could be the difficulty to find eggs in the field because of the size of the eggs, the inaccessible places of oviposition (cracks of walls) and the possibility to find only the chorion (without operculum). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This problem is true for most Triatomini eggs, but can be ruled out for the gluing eggs such as those of Rhodniini: the R. ecuadoriensis eggs were found fastened in abundance to various substrates, like chicken nests, clothes, walls, or any material accumulated in the domicile and peridomicile. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Because the eggs presented higher discrimination power than heads or wings, as between P. chinai and P. howardi, the method developed here should be recommended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Another reason for such recommendation could be related to the digitization facilities when dealing with a simple egg shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Such form is liable to be digitized automatically (see for instance the Conte function in [52]), and an automatic digitization could speed up the data collection and reduce the measurement error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>But even after manual digitization, the measurement error was very low (2.33% for the outline-based approach, 5% for the semilandmarks-based one). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Our data open new avenues of research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Due to the promising virtues of egg morphometrics, more species comparisons may be expected, and from an epidemiological point of view, it would be important to check for possible discrimination between eggs whose parentals were collected in different habitats (domicile, peridomicile and sylvatic) or between hatched eggs (eggs without operculum). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Eggs should not be used only for systematic purposes: we could expect indeed their shape to witness some changes due to impaired viability, or to natural hybridisation as found between many “species” in the Triatominae [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Moreover, their symmetry (“object symmetry”, as described by Mardia et al. [54]) could help exploring the external or internal sources of developmental stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Finally, some technical improvements should be considered in the near future, especially the testing of automatic digitization. </plain></SENT>
