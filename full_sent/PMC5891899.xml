</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Articular cartilage is composed of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix, which primarily consists of collagen II and proteoglycans [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It covers the metaphysis of long bones and provides shock absorption and lubrication to diarthrodial joints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cartilage tissue has poor self-healing capacity because it is avascular and thus has inadequate access to progenitor cells from blood and bone marrow (BM), which facilitate regeneration [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The articular cartilage defect is accompanied by pain and loss of function, and progressive breakdown leads to degenerative disorders, such as osteoarthritis, which can seriously affect a patient’s life and work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies had indicated that cartilage defects were found in 60% of patients who undergone arthroscopic surgery and that the main population included young adults [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the optional repair and regeneration of cartilage defect is an important issue in medical research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated from various tissues and can differentiate into chondrogenic lineage cells in vitro and in vivo [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In 2002, Wakitani et al. [6] applied bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantations to repair human articular cartilage defects in osteoarthritic knee joints and observed that the cartilage defects were partially covered with hyaline cartilage-like tissue, which highlighted the availability of autologous culture-expanded BMSC transplantation for the repair of articular cartilage defects in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since then, numerous studies on using BMSCs to repair cartilage lesions, from preclinical findings to clinical application, have been performed as BMSCs can be easily obtained and used [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The transplantation of BMSCs has become one of the main methods for treating cartilage defects [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, the majority focused on how to optimize the microenvironment or improve the efficiency of chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and there was no concern about adverse factors in the differentiation process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As a key component of smoking, nicotine has negative effects on tissue repair and healing [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>An epidemiological study had demonstrated that nicotine abuse was a high-risk factor that influences the clinical outcome of cartilage defects repair of the knee [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Our previous study indicated that prenatal nicotine exposure induced fetal articular dyschondroplasia [14].The epiphyseal cartilage development is a process of proliferation and differentiation of MSCs [15], in which nicotine can interfere with the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The process of repairing cartilage defects is also a process of chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells [16]; therefore, nicotine may have an adverse effect on the chondrogenic repair of BMSCs in cartilage defects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our previous work has demonstrated that nicotine could suppress the chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs and result in poorly differentiated cartilage [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>SRY-type high mobility group box 9 (Sox9) is a key regulator and controls the expression of the α1 chain of type II collagen (Col2A1) gene in the initiation stage of MSC chondrogenic differentiation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>During primary chondrogenesis, which is activated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Sox9 binds to essential sequences in the Col2A1 gene enhancers and initiates its expression [19].The functional modulation of Sox9 is a critical step for the initiation of chondrogenesis and is mainly regulated by histone acetylation [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor NFATp (NFATc2) is a repressor of chondrogenesis [21] and can interact with histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins to induce gene silencing [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Calcineurin (CaN), an upstream molecule of NFATc2, is induced by increased Ca2+ and can translocate the dephosphorylated NFATc2 into the nucleus [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The stimulus of nicotine can increase the intracellular Ca2+ of MSCs through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that nicotine could decrease Sox9’s promoter histone acetylation and inhibit its expression through HDAC recruitment by the activated nAChR/Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT pathway in BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we confirmed that nicotine interfered with BMSC transplantation repair of cartilage defects by inhibiting Sox9 expression in vivo and that nicotine-induced Sox9 gene suppression via nAChRs is mediated directly by decreasing the histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The mixture containing BMSCs (2 × 106 cells/ml) and 1.25% alginate in 0.15 M saline [26] was then transplanted into the full-thickness defect in the right knee. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks post-transplantation, the defects showed very poor cartilage repair (Additional file 1), whose surface was concave, irregular or sometimes empty in the middle and few regenerated tissues could be seen at peripheral regions, meaning that this size of articular cartilage defect in a rat joint is a critical-size defect that cannot heal by itself. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The altered gene expression and promoter acetylation patterns could be blocked by antagonism of α7-nAChR, indicating that the direct effect of nicotine is mediated by α7-nAChR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Therefore, nicotine could interfere with cartilage repair through suppressing Sox9 expression in chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par52"><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Nicotine is a high-risk factor for many diseases and has negative effects on soft and bony tissue healing [11, 12], which can also influence the repair of cartilage defects and suppress the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs [13, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of nicotine’s adverse effect is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Previous researches had clarified the chondrogenic potential of MSCs involved in cartilage regeneration [28, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the regenerated tissue in our study could have been differentiated from BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In addition to their differentiation potential, the paracrine action of MSCs was also believed to contribute to their therapeutic effects [32, 33], unknown factors secreted from BMSCs may stimulate chondrogenic differentiation in the repair process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believed the mechanism of cartilage repair in defect was associated with chondrogenic differentiation and the secretive action of BMSCs. Sox9 is a key transcriptional factor and plays an important role in the process of chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In the initial stage of chondrogenesis, mesenchymal stem cells condense and then differentiate into chondrocytes. Sox9 can bind to essential sequences in the Col2A1 gene at chondrocyte-specific enhancers and activate its expression, and Sox9 has been identified as a regulator of the chondrocyte lineage [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Research had shown that the inactivation of Sox9 in limb buds before mesenchymal condensation resulted in a complete absence of cartilage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>A delayed development of cartilage can also be induced when the Sox9 gene is inactivated after chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Thus, Sox9 is essential in the condensed stage of MSCs and subsequent differentiation in the process of cartilage formation [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In addition, Sox9 also plays an essential role in the physiological control of cartilaginous tissues [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>BMSCs with Sox9 gene transfer by adenovirus could promote cartilage defect repair [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Sox9 also play an important role in cartilage repair using BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Our results found that nicotine reduced Sox9 expression in the regenerated tissue in the cartilage defect area, which demonstrated that nicotine has an adverse effect on cartilage repair through the suppression of Sox9 in regenerated tissue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par53"><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDACs are two classes of histone acetylation enzymes, which determine the acetylation status of histones of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The activated balance of HATs and HDACs affects the regulation of gene expression [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The reduction of acetylation in the transcriptional regulatory regions often leads to the inhibition of gene expression [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The Sox9-based transcriptional complex, including CBP/p300, which has an intrinsic HATs activity, plays an important role in the initiation of chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression of Sox9 itself is mainly regulated by histone acetylation [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Histone acetylation is concentrated mainly on histone 3 and histone 4 [40], and H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation often co-occur at many gene regulatory elements and adjust the gene expression in stem cells [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we focused on nicotine’s regulation of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation of Sox9 during the process of chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>We observed that nicotine could reduce the expression of Sox9 through decreasing H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation of the Sox9 promoter region and finally suppress the chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro data are consistent with the in vivo results where nicotine directly decreased the expression of Sox9 through α7-nAChR by suppressing the histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter during the process of BMSCs chondrogenic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par54"><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>NFAT is a family of transcription factors critical in regulating early gene transcription in response to T cell receptor-mediated signals in lymphocytes [42]. NFATc2 is a repressor of chondrogenesis [21] and can induce gene silencing through interaction with HDAC [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that NFATc2 could bind with Sox9 and recruit HDAC1 to decrease the histone acetylation of theSox9 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Calcineurin (also called protein phosphatase 2B), the only serine/threonine protein phosphatase under the control of Ca2+/calmodulin, plays a critical role in the coupling of Ca2+ signals to cellular responses [43]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The complex regulation of calcineurin can dephosphorylate phosphorylated serine/threonine proteins and initiate multiple pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>NFATc2 is the downstream signal of calcineurin [44], and the response to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ is dependent upon the dephosphorylation of NFATc2 by calcineurin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The activated calcineurin controls the translocation of NFAT proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and regulates the expression of target genes [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Neuronal nAchR is usually in excitable cells of the central nervous system and controls the influx and efflux of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Recent studies found that nAchR was also in non-excitable cells outside the nervous system [24, 46], providing physiologic functions in these cells [47], in which Ca2+ plays an important role in a signaling cascade activated by nAchR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of MSCs with nicotine induced increases of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and initiated the downstream pathway of cascade activation while MLA, which is the specific antagonist of α7-nAChR, could inhibit the calcium influx [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that α7-nAChR was presented in BMSCs and a nicotine stimulus could increase intracellular Ca2+ and the enzyme activity of calcineurin of BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The expression of dephosphorylated NFATc2 in the cytoplasm decreased and NFATc2 in the nucleus increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Therefore, nicotine could activate Ca2+/Calcineurin/NFAT signaling in BMSCs throughα7-nAChR, resulting in recruitment of HDAC1, which decreased histone acetylation of the Sox9 promoter region and finally inhibited BMSC chondrogenic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par55"><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The dose of nicotine exposure in our study is 2 mg/kg/d, which is consistent with previous animal studies [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>According to a previous investigation, an average tobacco rod contains 10–14 mg of nicotine, and on average, approximately 1.5 mg of nicotine is absorbed systemically during smoking [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Based on the dose–conversion correlation between humans and rats (human: rats = 1: 6.17) [52], the dose of nicotine exposure in the present study is equivalent to the nicotine exposure in an adult weighing approximately 70 kg smoking 2.3 cigarettes per day (calculated as follows: 2 mg/kg/d ÷ 6.17 × 70 kg ÷ 10 mg/cigarette = 2.3 cigarettes/d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The definition of nicotine dependence is the equivalent of more than ten cigarettes per day, and each cigarette contains at least 0.5 mg nicotine [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The dose of nicotine in our study was lower than the actual exposure of nicotine dependence in daily life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The present results showed the obvious impact of nicotine on cartilage repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Thus nicotine’s adverse effect with nicotine dependence would be more serious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The concentration of nicotine (0.01–10 μM) used in our chondrogenic differentiation model is consistent with those often used in pluripotent stem cell studies [54, 55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The blood concentrations of nicotine during daily smoking are 0.06 μM to 0.23 μM [56], the initial concentration of nicotine in our study was 0.1 μM, which was within the range of a daily smoker’s nicotinic blood concentration and could suppress the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Based on the principle of toxicology, we set a concentration gradient from 0.1 to 100 μM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The result showed that nicotinic suppression on BMSC chondrogenic differentiation has concentration-dependent characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Although the largest nicotine exposure used in the present study was 100 μM, which was significantly higher than the plasma nicotine level of nicotine dependence, the result was the most obvious and the reversing experiment verified the key point of the molecular mechanism in this concentration, which is also helpful in clarifying the molecular mechanism. </plain></SENT>
