</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In humans, neurogenesis has been observed in two regions of the adult brain: the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus has been linked to numerous phenomena, including but not limited to learning, memory, conditioning, and pattern separation [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Some animal models of depression demonstrate reduced dentate gyrus neurogenesis; neurogenesis is necessary for certain antidepressants to be effective [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Developing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying dentate gyrus neurogenesis could provide strategies to manipulate these neural processes for therapeutic gain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Over the course of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, continuously dividing neuronal progenitor cells residing in the subgranular zone migrate as immature neurons to the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, where they differentiate into granule cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These neurons also functionally integrate into hippocampal circuitry by extending both axons and dendrites, subsequently forming synapses with mature neurons [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The transition of neurons from an immature to a mature state involves many changes to diverse cellular functions, one being cell cycle arrest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Long-term cell cycle arrest, the G0 or quiescent phase, is crucial for maintenance of the highly specialized mature neuronal phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Failure of neurons to maintain the G0 phase is associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Recent studies show microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in regulating neuronal gene expression, which can impact neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These miRNAs include miR-132, which is most highly expressed in mature neurons, and miR-137, which inhibits synaptic integration and dendritic spine growth when knocked down [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis is a highly activity-dependent phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus increases in response to direct hippocampal stimulation as well as processes stimulating the hippocampus, such as exercise, spatial learning, and an enriched environment [14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>If these newborn neurons do not receive sufficient stimulation, they become much less likely to survive to maturity [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Once these neurons begin forming synapses, successful integration into existing neurocircuits also depends on the level of stimulation they receive [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies identified 10 activity-dependent miRNAs significantly upregulated following pilocarpine-induced seizures [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To determine which of these miRNAs plays a role in neurogenesis, we developed a lentiviral sensor to detect miRNAs in vivo, and found significant miR-338-3p expression in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we determined miR-338-3p to be most highly expressed in mature neurons. In vivo miR-338-3p knockdown revealed that granule cells deficient in miR-338-3p sprout multiple primary dendrites and change their overall organization, increasing their number of dendrites and altering branching angles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We observed in vivo miR-338-3p knockdown created regions of cellular neoplasia resembling glioblastoma (GBM) in the dentate gyrus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Overexpressing miR-338-3p in vitro confirmed our findings with regards to neoplasia, significantly decreasing the proliferation rate of miR-338-3p-deficient GBM cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude miR-338-3p endogenously regulates maturation of neurons, and miR-338-3p loss-of-function could contribute to tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We previously determined which miRNAs were most likely to affect neurogenesis by identifying miRNAs whose expression is induced by neuronal activity in a pilocarpine seizure model [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We selected the -3p and -5p species of the five most upregulated miRNAs for the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We designed a lentiviral sensor system to detect the miRNAs of interest via their binding to complementary mRNA sequences, which blocks translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We achieved this by cloning two miRNA-complementary target sequences into the 3’ UTR of mCherry in a lentiviral vector (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Thus, endogenous miRNAs will bind the mCherry transcript’s target sequences, blocking its translation and reducing the level of mCherry fluorescence in cells expressing the miRNA of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, if the cell expresses the miRNA of interest, mCherry fluorescence will be inhibited. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>MiR-338-3p regulates axonal outgrowth in cortical neurons through regulation of Robo2, an axonal guidance protein [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>It also regulates axonal outgrowth in superior cervical ganglion neurons through COXIV and ATP5G1, two mitochondrial mRNAs active in oxidative phosphorylation [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>MiR-338-3p is also expressed in spinal cord oligodendrocytes, where it exerts a related effect, inducing maturation and differentiation of precursors into mature oligodendrocytes by repressing Sox5 and Hes6, two maturation-inhibiting transcription factors [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Studying the effect of miR-338-3p on the expression of any of these genes or any in the same pathway could possibly provide a mechanistic understanding for how these primary dendrite changes are induced. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>General loss of miRNA function through Dicer1 ablation produces a wide range of changes in hippocampal dendrites, including but not limited to increased dendritic spine length, reduced dendritic arborization, and a bias toward arborization more distal to the soma [38, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe any of these morphological changes in miR-338-3p knockdown neurons, indicating miR-338-3p is unlikely to contribute to miRNA regulation of these facets of hippocampal neuron morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The suite of changes we did observe were not studied in Dicer1-inactivated neurons, and examination of such changes in loss of general miRNA function could prove interesting as well. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>MiR-338-3p has previously been implicated in tumor suppression in hepatocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and brain cancer [40–44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found miR-338-3p knockdown leads to the formation of multiple neoplastic growths resembling GBM, showing a direct causal link between loss of miR-338-3p function and hippocampal tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Further, we find miR-338-3p expression in GBM cell lines decreases their proliferation in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Another study shows reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in certain glioma cell lines following overexpression of miR-338-3p, which may at least partially explain the change in proliferation we observe [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, a recent study expressing miR-338-3p in U251 cells describes a different phenomenon, where induction of miR-338-3p expression has no effect on U251 proliferation [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>These differences could be explained by divergent methodologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Wang et al. examined changes during the first 96 hours of infection, while this study begins analysis 7 days after infection; differences in the time course of regulated genes’ activity could underlie differences observed between the two studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Differences could also be explained by the manner of infection: while our vector contained only the miR-338-3p sequence, Wang et al. uses a longer sequence surrounding miR-338-3p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Regulatory elements within the sequence or miRNA processing differences could also contribute to the difference in effects observed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>While miR-338-3p is instrumental to tumor suppression, we do not know its exact mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have determined that miR-338-3p inhibits cellular proliferation in GBM cell lines, mirroring the results of a similar analysis done on the role of miR-338-3p in colorectal carcinoma implicating loss of SMO inhibition [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>It is possible these two tumor types could be suppressed via the same method of regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to understand whether miR-338-3p operates through a similar mechanism in GBM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Upon histological examination of the tumor, it is clear that not every neoplastic cell is miR-338-3p deficient, but rather the core lacks miR-338-3p while cells at the periphery of the neoplasm maintain relatively normal levels of miR-338-3p expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar pattern of miR-338-3p expression was found in the tumors of 15 GBM patients [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Further, the proliferating BrdU-positive cells in the neoplasms we describe appear to be those peripheral cells not expressing low levels of miR-338-3p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Such a pattern of proliferation suggests a potential cell-nonautonomous regulatory mechanism, which has not described previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This result is unexpected, based on our other data, and warrants further study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>One prior study in pituitary adenoma describes a mechanism of tumor suppression via regulation of Pttg, a paracrine growth factor, in pituitary adenoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>However, this study did not examine in vivo proliferation, and the gene’s expression has not been described in the hippocampus thus far [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Regulation of CyclinD1 expression has been similarly implicated as a potential mechanism by which miR-338-3p affects cell proliferation [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>CyclinD1 and associated CDKs may act as a “switch” in the cell cycle, and their activity is inhibited in terminally differentiated neurons but high in the embryonic nervous system [48–51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CyclinD1 and these CDKs may control angles of neurite formation in hippocampal granule cells [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Thus, the phenotypes observed in this study are consistent with the finding that miR-338-3p regulates CyclinD1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that these changes are induced by loss of inhibition of PREX2a, another target of miR-338-3p [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>A phenotype with multiple primary dendrites is associated with loss of Pten, which inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>PREX2a inhibits Pten activity itself, and the phenotype resulting from loss of PREX2a regulation by miR-338-3p should resemble the one resulting from loss of Pten. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Prior studies have already shown miR-338-3p’s inhibition of PREX2a is crucial in suppression of neuroblastoma proliferation [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified a regulatory role for miR-338-3p in neuronal proliferation, maturation, and neurite outgrowth and organization in the dentate gyrus, while also acting as a tumor suppressor in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>While we did observe physiological changes in the neuron, the mechanisms by which miR-338-3p activity regulates these processes in the dentate gyrus are not yet fully characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>An important topic for further research will be the determination of which pathways are responsible for the myriad changes observed in the miR-338-3p-deficient hippocampal neuron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>However, our results in GBM are encouraging, and could indicate GBM therapeutics targeting miR-338-3p could be a promising line of inquiry. </plain></SENT>
