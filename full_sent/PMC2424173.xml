</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It has long been known that increases in passive tension evoke contraction of smooth muscle in arteries [1], and evidence suggests that the underlying mechanism involves graded increases in Ca2+ within vascular smooth muscle cells as arteries are pressurized [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Similarly, hollow smooth muscle organs such as the bladder, gallbladder, and gastrointestine undergo significant changes in wall tension associated with filling and distension, with attendant changes in muscle tone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previously we demonstrated that increases in cell length trigger the gating of ryanodine receptor (RYR) Ca2+ release channels, resulting in a release of Ca2+ from the SR in the form of Ca2+ sparks or propagated Ca2+ waves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This stretch -induced Ca2+ release (SICR) process does not require an influx of extracellular Ca2+ ions, activation of ionic currents, or even a rise in [Ca2+]i [3], despite the fact that stretch of smooth muscle cells may activate non-selective cation channels [4]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the mechanism leading to Ca2+ release following stretch of urinary bladder smooth muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>NO is a cellular second messenger that mediates numerous biological functions such as vasodilation, muscle contractility [8], [9], anti-apoptosis [10], heart rate, and heart development [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyze NO formation, with eNOS accounting for most production in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that stretch is associated with increased tissue NO formation in cardiac muscle [14]–[16], which may act to alter force production through effects on Ca2+ release by SR ryanodine receptors (RYR) [16], [17]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>NOS activation by stretch of cardiac muscle is mediated by activation of the PI(3)K−Akt−endothelial NOS axis, and contributes to myocardial contractile activation during heart stretch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Recently we demonstrated that cell stretch induces Ca2+ release in the form of Ca2+ sparks in smooth muscle cells isolated from the urinary bladder [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The upstream transduction mechanism linking cell elongation to Ca2+ release in smooth muscle is not known, however. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the signaling pathways mediating stretch-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We report that smooth muscle stretch enhances NO production and that this increase correlates with augmented RYR -mediated Ca2+ sparks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The production of NO is both necessary and sufficient to trigger Ca2+ sparks, as stretch –induced Ca2+ sparks were not activated under conditions of NOS inhibition or in eNOS knockout smooth muscle, and exogenous NO restored stretch –induced Ca2+ release in eNOS knockout cells, indicating that, NO mediates stretch-induced Ca2+ release through activation of PI(3)K-Akt−endothelial NOS axis in smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>To investigate the underlying mechanism of stretch-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscle, we examined the properties of Ca2+ sparks at slack and stretched cell length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Stretch of single mouse bladder smooth muscle cells by 9% to 18% of the slack length triggered Ca2+ sparks and/or waves as previously reported [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The probability (percent of experiments or cells with Ca2+ sparks) and frequency of Ca2+ release events induced by stretch were highly related to both the degree of stretch and the time that stretch was maintained. Figure 1A shows that how single cells were stretched. Figure 1B shows linescan images from different stretch lengths; at 9% increased length, the probability of Ca2+ release events was 19.2% (5 out of 26 cells with Ca2+ release events), whereas stretch to 18% from slack produced Ca2+ release events in 82.2±7.4% (23 out of 28 cells) of cells, or a 3.1 fold increase in release probability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>A similar finding was also obtained from x-y images recorded by confocal microscopy (Olympus, FV 1000, Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Ca2+ spark frequency was also dependent on the extent of stretch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Elongation of myocytes by 9% of resting length (ΔL = 9%) resulted in a Ca2+ spark frequency of 3.7±0.92 per second (Fig. 1B&amp;E), while the frequency was 8.1±1.43 per second at ΔL = 18%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of the time of stretch on Ca2+ release events, cells were stretched by 9% (ΔL = 9%) from slack and maintained at the length for 5 min (Figure 1 D&amp;E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Both Ca2+ spark probability and spark frequency were markedly and significantly increased after 5 min (17.2% (5 out of 29 cells with Ca2+ release) vs 79.0% (26 out of 33 cells with Ca2+ release), and 3.5±0.46 vs 8.1±1.76/second, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Thus Ca2+ spark probability and frequency are a function of the length of individual myocytes, and augmented Ca2+ release is maintained after acute stretch. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Here we have examined the mechanism underlying stretch-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Our main finding is that stretch-induced Ca2+ sparks are both the stretch length and time dependent (Fig. 1) and are mediated by the generation of NO and that the action of NO is independent of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The augmentation of Ca2+ spark probability and frequency observed after cell elongation were abolished by incubation with the NO inhibitor, L-NAME, and enhanced by the NO donor, SNAP (Fig. 2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Moreover, elongation of smooth muscle resulted in an increase in NO production in tissue segments and single cells (Fig. 5) and eNOS gene inactivation resulted in the loss of SICR, but not CICR (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We have also demonstrated a functional role for NO coupling to SICR: stretch –induced contractions were inhibited by L-NAME and enhanced by SNAP (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The production of NO preceded the induction of Ca2+ sparks (Fig. 6 C&amp;D), but its action was not dependent on soluble guanylyl cyclase activity and the activation of PKG, as SICR occurred in the presence of sGC and PKG inhibitors, and was not augmented by a cell permeant cGMP analogue (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, release was inhibited by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY492004 and wortmannin (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Moreover, phosphorylation assay of Akt and eNOS demonstrated that both phospho-Akt and phospho-eNOS levels were greatly up-regulated by stretch (Fig. 8), suggesting the activation of PI(3)K/Akt pathway by stretch further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>These findings establish NO as a critical coupling molecule linking membrane tension to SR Ca2+ release. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>NO has been shown to increase the activity of ryanodine receptors in cardiac [14], [16] and skeletal [18], [26] muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>As the stimulation of guanylyl cyclase by NO is a prominent smooth muscle relaxant mechanism [27], the role of NO in SICR seems counter intuitive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, similar to cardiac muscle, SICR is independent of the activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG, indicating a compartmentalization of NO signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Wees et al linked stretch –induced NO formation and Ca2+ release to the stimulation of integrins [14], presenting evidence that release occurs through the stimulation of cardiac type, RYR2, ryanodine receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that SICR in smooth muscle also occurs through the activation of RYR2 SR channels [3], [22]. it has been known that FKBP12.6 is closely associated with RYR2 [28], we, therefore, further examined SICR in FKBP12.6 deletion urinary bladder smooth myocytes in order to supporting SICR occurs through activation of RYR2 in smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that Ca2+ spark property and kinetics were significantly altered by stretch in FKBP12.6 null myocytes compared to that in wildtype myoccytes (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus SICR in smooth muscle bears essential similarities to that of cardiac muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Although recent work in mouse embryo bladder myocytes demonstrated that RYR1 is required for depolarization-induced Ca2+ spark [29], our conclusion that stretch-induced Ca2+ spark was mediated by activation of RYR2 does not oppose the voltage depolarizing induced Ca2+ release through RYR1 in mouse embryo bladder smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This was also proved by the parallel experiments of stretch and voltage depolarization carried out in eNOS-/- myocytes (Fig. 3) in the present study that stretch did not cause Ca2+ spark but membrane voltage depolarization did, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of stretch-induced Ca2+ spark and voltage depolarization induced Ca2+ spark are different. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear how NO affects Ca2+ release via RyR2. </plain></SENT>
