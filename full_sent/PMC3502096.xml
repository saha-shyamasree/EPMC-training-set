<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that in the mouse the developmental switching of globin gene expression correlates with the reconfiguration of an active chromatin hub (ACH), a complex of promoters of transcribed genes with distant regulatory elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it is likely that observations made in the mouse β-globin gene domain are also relevant for this locus in other species, the validity of this supposition still lacks direct experimental evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we have studied the spatial organization of the chicken β-globin gene domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This domain is of particular interest because it represents the perfect example of the so-called ‘strong’ tissue-specific gene domain flanked by insulators, which delimit the area of preferential sensitivity to DNase I in erythroid cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to observations made in the mouse model, we found that in the chicken, the early embryonic β-globin gene, Ε, did not interact with the locus control region in RBCs of embryonic lineage (3-day RBCs), where this gene is actively transcribed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The domain of chicken beta-globin genes is located on chromosome 1 and has a length of approximately 33 kb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It includes a cluster of four beta-globin genes: ρ (HBG1), βH (HBE1), βA (HBG2) and Ε (HBE) and several distant regulatory regions, which are marked with sites of hypersensitivity to DNase I (HS) and are necessary for the regulation of transcription, replication and chromatin status of the domain [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The locus control region of the domain (LCR) is located upstream of the embryonic β-globin gene ρ and is composed of three blocks co-localizing with the erythroid cell-specific HSs 1 to 3 [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A constitutive HS4 located upstream of the LCR marks the position of the well-studied CTCF-dependent (CTCF ‐ Ð¡Ð¡Ð¡TC-binding protein factor) insulator [5-9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The CTCF-dependent enhancer-blocking element is also located at the downstream end of the domain in the area marked by the so-called 3′ constitutive HS [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition to the LCR, the domain also possesses an internal enhancer (β/Ε-enhancer), which is located between the genes βA and Ε and is believed to contribute to the control of the activity of both genes [12-14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The partitioning of tasks between the LCR and the β/Ε-enhancer is not quite clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The results of experiments with transgenic mice carrying the chicken β-globin gene domain [4] suggested that the expression of one of the embryonic genes (ρ) is controlled by the LCR, while the expression of the other embryonic gene (Ε) is controlled by the β/Ε-enhancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, both regulatory elements appeared to be necessary for the correct developmental expression of the adult β-globin genes [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The domain of the chicken β-globin gene represents one of the best-studied genomic areas in higher eukaryotes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This domain possesses all of the characteristic features of the so-called closed or strong chromatin domains [16,17], which change the pattern of sensitivity to DNase I in a cell lineage-specific fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies of the distribution of different histone modifications along the domain have contributed much to the present knowledge about the histone code [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the mechanisms of transcriptional switching of chicken β-globin gene expression remain poorly understood [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The developmental switching of globin gene transcription is typical for all vertebrate organisms [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In chickens, the first molecules of hemaglobin appear in embryonic erythroblasts 32 h after fertilization [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The beta-chains of the hemaglobin represent the products of genes ρ and Ε, which are transcribed from the 2nd to the 5th day of the embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>After the 5th day a new population of erythroid cells expressing the genes of fetal and adult globins βН and βA appears. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These cells gradually replace the embryonic-type erythroblasts that express genes 1ρ and Ε[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In erythroblasts of adult lineage, the transcription of embryonic β-type globin genes is repressed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, it is worth mentioning that the total amount of RNA routinely extracted from the same number of 3-day and 9-day RBCs was much higher in the case of 3-day RBCs (approximately 50 μg and 1.7 μg from 10 million 3-day and 9-day RBCs, respectively). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The quantitative chromosome conformation capture (3C-qPCR) assay was used to investigate the spatial organization of the chicken β-globin gene domain in RBCs of 3- and 9-day-old embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It is well known that the accurate analysis and interpretation of raw 3C data is not a trivial task [27], and it can be difficult to distinguish the relevant chromatin interactions from background and cross-linking artifacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>One problem in the interpretation of the 3C data is that neighboring restriction fragments are always ligated to a certain extent due to cross-links between nucleosomal proteins, even if these fragments are not involved in the assembly of a chromatin hub. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To discriminate the functionally relevant interactions from the background cross-linking, we performed the 3C analysis of the β-globin gene domain in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>These cells do not express globin genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Thus, there are good reasons to expect that the domain in these cells does not adopt any functionally relevant spatial configuration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In the main set of 3C experiments, we used MboI restriction enzyme digestion to cleave the DNA before the proximity ligation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>This enzyme cuts the β-globin gene domain into a number of relatively small fragments, such that the promoters of β-globin genes and regulatory elements were located in different restriction fragments separated by several cleavage sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>It was thus possible to independently analyze all of these regulatory elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In some cases, however, it was not possible to place the primers and TaqMan™ probes exactly on the regulatory element under study due to the small size of the corresponding restriction fragment or the presence of repetitive sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the primers and TaqMan™ probes were placed at the adjacent restriction fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For example, for βA and Ε genes, the probes were placed at the fragments located just downstream of the promoters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We have first fixed the anchor at the restriction fragment containing HS2 (a part of β-globin domain LCR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In the 3-day RBCs, this anchor was shown to interact preferentially with the fragments containing the promoter of the embryonic gene ρ, the adult gene βA and the β/Ε-enhancer (Figure 2B, blue curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In addition, an elevated frequency of interaction of the HS2 with the upstream and the downstream insulators of the β-globin gene domain was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no interaction of the HS2 with the embryonic gene Ε was detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>As expected, no interaction between any of the functional elements studied was detected in embryonic fibroblasts (Figure 2B, green curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In 9-day RBCs the frequency of interactions of the HS2 with the βA gene increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In addition, a strong interaction between the HS2 and the promoter of βH gene was established (Figure 2B, red curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The validity of the observations made with the anchor placed at HS2 was confirmed in experiments with the anchor placed on the promoter of the ρ gene (Figure 2C), the upstream portion of the βA gene (Figure 2D), the upstream portion of the Ε gene (Figure 2F) and the β/Ε-enhancer (Figure 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The anchor placed on the promoter of the ρ gene demonstrated strong interaction frequencies with the HSs 1‐3 of the LCR in 3-day RBCs (Figure 2C, blue curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The frequency of interaction of this anchor with the HS1 remained about the same in 9-day RBCs while the frequencies of interaction with the HSs 2 and 3 decreased (Figure 2C, red curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, in 3-day RBCs the promoter of the ρ gene demonstrated a strong interaction with the upstream region of the βA gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this interaction decreased in 9-day RBCs but still remained quite prominent (Figure 2C, blue and red curves). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The interaction between ρ and βA genes was also observed in embryonic fibroblasts (Figure 2C, green curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>It may thus reflect some internal feature of the β-globin gene domain spatial organization that is not related to the transcriptional status of the domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the βA and ρ gene promoters observed in the experiment with the anchor placed on the ρ gene promoter was confirmed in the reciprocal experiment with the anchor placed on the upstream part of the βA gene (Figure 2D, all curves). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>No interaction of the ρ gene promoter with the promoter of the minor adult βH gene was observed in 3-day RBC (Figure 2C, blue curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the same cells (3-day RBC) the upstream region of the βA gene demonstrated strong interactions with both the ρ and βH gene promoters (Figure 2D, blue curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>As expected, the upstream region of the βA gene demonstrated a strong interaction with the HSs 1 to 3 of the LCR in 9-day RBCs, but not in 3-day RBCs (Figure 2D, red and blue curves). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>A strong interaction of the βA gene with the β/Ε enhancer was also observed in 9-day but not in 3-day RBCs (Figure 2D, red and blue curves). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Although in this particular case the anchor (the upstream part of the βA gene) and the test-fragment (β/Ε enhancer) are located close to each other, the much higher interaction frequency observed in 9-day RBCs comparing to 3-day RBCs and CEF argues for the existence of functionally relevant interaction between the βA gene and the β/Ε enhancer in 9-day RBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the results of a reciprocal experiment with the anchor placed on the β/Ε enhancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Again, in 9-day RBCs the frequency of interaction of the β/Ε enhancer with the upstream part of the βA gene was much higher in 9-day RBCs than in 3-day RBCs and CEF (Figure 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The interaction of the β/Ε enhancer with the three HSs of the LCR and the promoter of ρ gene was observed in both 3-day and 9-day RBCs, but not in CEF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, interaction of the β/Ε enhancer with the promoter of gene βH was observed only in 9-day RBCs (Figure 2E, red curve). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>No interaction of the β/Ε enhancer with the gene Ε was observed in either of the cell lines studied (Figure 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In full accord with this observation, the anchor placed on the upstream area of the gene Ε showed no interaction with any of the test fragments studied in either erythroid or non-erythroid cells (Figure 2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that the Ε gene does not interact with any of the remote regulatory elements of the domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>To verify this interesting observation, we performed 3C experiments using digestion with another restriction enzyme, NlaIII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Distribution of NlaIII recognition sites along the β-globin gene domain allows fixation of the anchor exactly on the promoter of the gene Ε. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Using this anchor we performed 3C analysis of the β-globin domain configuration in 3-day RBCs and in CEF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Again, no interaction of the Ε gene promoter with any of the remote regulatory elements was observed (Figure 2G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>As a matter of fact, the frequencies of interaction of the Ε gene promoter with all tested fragments of the β-globin gene domain were very similar in 3-day RBCs that express the Ε gene and in embryonic fibroblasts that do not express globin genes at all. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The current model of the enhancer action suggests that enhancers directly interact with target promoters [23,28-30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>As a result, an assembly of regulatory elements, called the active chromatin hub (ACH), forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>One or several enhancers present in the ACH may control the activity of one or several promoters recruited to the ACH [23,29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional switching of murine β-globin gene expression correlates with a reconfiguration of the ACH [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether the developmental switching of chicken β-globin gene transcription depends on the spatial reconfiguration of the β-globin gene domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The study of the chicken β-globin gene domain is particularly interesting for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>First, this domain is the best example of the so-called closed chromatin domains [17], as the upstream and the downstream insulators perfectly delimit the area of preferential sensitivity to DNase I in erythroid cells [31], which is not the case in mouse and human β-globin gene domains [32,33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Second, the chicken β-globin gene domain contains an internal enhancer element in addition to the upstream locus control region [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Once again, this is not the case in the mouse or human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Hence, the regulation of chicken β-globin gene expression may differ from regulation of β-globin gene expression in the mouse and human. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study showed that in erythroid cells there is a clear interaction of the upstream and the downstream insulators of the chicken β-globin gene domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>As a result, the domain should be organized in a closed loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Although we have not studied the mechanism of this loop formation, it is very probable that CTCF is involved, as both insulators possess CTCF-binding sites [9,10] and it was shown that CTCF might mediate an interaction between distant genomic elements [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>It is also likely that the β-globin loop ends are fixed at the nuclear matrix, as the 5′ insulator of the chicken β-globin gene domain has been reported to interact with the nuclear matrix [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>This type of spatial organization perfectly explains the fact that in the chicken β-globin gene domain, the area demonstrating the cell-lineage-specific sensitivity to DNase I perfectly co-localizes with the genomic segment flanked by insulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this model, the interaction between the upstream and the downstream insulators of the chicken β-globin gene domain was not observed in non-erythroid cells where the domain is not preferentially sensitive to DNase I [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In should be mentioned, however, that in mouse and human the insulators flanking the β-globin gene domain from the upstream and the downstream also interact with each other [22,24,34], although the chromatin loop established by this interaction does not correspond to the region of preferential sensitivity to DNase I [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The most interesting feature of the spatial organization of the chicken β-globin gene domain is that the embryonic β-globin gene Ε interacts with neither the LCR nor the β/Ε enhancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This does not exclude the possibility that the β/Ε enhancer located at a short distance upstream of the Ε gene can activate this gene promoter by some tracking mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>However, an activation effect of the LCR on Ε gene transcription seems very improbable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it is of interest that in the chicken α-globin gene domain, the embryonic gene π also does not interact with any of the known distant regulatory elements of the domain [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>It is thus likely that in the chicken, both α-type and β-type early embryonic globin genes possess an autonomous regulatory system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In regard to the composition of the β-globin domain ACH in 3-day and 9-day RBCs, we noted several unexpected features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>First of all, the HS2 of LCR shows a significant frequency of interaction with the promoter of the βA gene already in 3-day RBCs where the level of this gene transcription is very low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Still it is detectable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was reported that the βA gene is transcribed to some extend even in 2-day RBCs [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Hence, the interaction of the βA gene with the LCR in 3-day RBCs may be functionally relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we observed a strong interaction between the promoters of the ρ and βA genes, which was especially prominent in 3-day RBCs in which the level of the βA gene transcription is very low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of this interaction is not clear at the moment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The fact that it was detected also in non-erythroid cells suggests that it may reflect some inherent feature of the β-globin gene domain spatial organization that is not directly related to the assembly of ACH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>It is of interest that despite the above-mentioned interaction between the ρ and βA promoters, the levels of interaction of these promoters with the LCR-HS2 differ significantly in 3-day RBCs (where the promoter of gene ρ interacts preferentially with the LCR-HS2) and 9-day RBCs (where the promoter of gene βA interacts preferentially with the LCR-HS2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is likely that the fine structure of the β-globin ACH is quite different in 3-day and 9-day RBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in 3-day RBCs, the promoter of gene ρ directly interacts with the LCR while the promoter of gene βA is passively pulled to the complex due to the interaction of βA and ρ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In 9-day RBCs the situation is reversed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Thus, in spite of interaction with each other, the genes ρ and βA demonstrate developmental stage-specific association with the LCR which correlates with the expression status of these genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Even more evident developmental stage-specific recruitment to the ACH shows the promoter of the minor adult β-type globin gene βH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The promoter of this gene demonstrates either no interaction or a strong interaction with the LCR at days 3 and 9 of the embryo development, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Finally, it should be mentioned that in both 3-day and 9-day RBCs, a significant level of interaction between the βA and βH promoters was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration the fact that the anchors placed on the LCR-HS2 and ρ gene promoter demonstrated no interaction with βH and a strong interaction with βA in 3-day RBCs, one must assume that at this developmental stage, the promoters of the two adult β-type globin genes can either interact with each other outside the ACH or the βA promoter can be recruited to the ACH via interaction with the ρ gene promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The two alternative configurations of the β-globin domain ACH in 3-day RBCs are shown in Figure 4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>β-globin active chromatin hubs in the nuclei of 3-day and 9-day red blood cells of chicken embryos.

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1756-8935-5-16-4"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In 9-day RBCs, the level of mutual interaction of most of the regulatory elements of the β-globin gene domain increases compared to the levels in 3-day RBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>These observations may reflect more compact packaging of the domain as a whole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Thus, it should be noted that 9-day RBCs differ drastically from the 3-day RBCs in the total amount of RNA, including rRNA, present in the cell (see the first section of the results). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Evidently, the 9-day RBCs are less metabolically active compared to 3-day RBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In other words, they possess certain features of mature chicken erythrocytes, which have non-active nuclei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the globin genes are still transcribed in the majority of 9-day RBCs [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Thus, the concept that the apparently more compact spatial organization of the β-globin gene domain in 9-day RBCs may simply reflect the presence of a substantial portion of mature erythrocytes in the analyzed cell population would not be correct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Rather, the β-globin gene domain suffers a certain amount of pressure because it is a part of the chromosomal territory that gradually acquires a more compact configuration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Regardless, it remains active and possesses certain features of an active chromatin domain, including a preferential sensitivity to DNase I, even in the compact nuclei of mature chicken erythrocytes [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The spatial isolation of this domain from the surrounding chromatin by the formation of a distinct chromatin loop via interaction of the flanking insulators may be of major importance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have analyzed the spatial configuration of the chicken β-globin gene domain in red blood cells of embryonic and adult lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The obtained results strongly support the active chromatin hub model, as it has been found that distant regulatory elements located upstream of the β-globin gene cluster form a complex with the β/Ε enhancer located in the downstream portion of the cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Promoters of all β-globin genes, with the exception of embryonic gene Ε, are recruited to this complex, demonstrating a specificity of interaction with the LCR in respect to the developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The embryonic β-globin gene Ε does not interact with any of the distal regulatory elements; thus, it is likely to possess an autonomous regulatory system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In both 3-day and 9-day RBCs the upstream and the downstream insulators of the chicken β-gene domain interact with each other, thus placing the domain in a separate chromatin loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This may explain the fact that in chickens, the borders of erythroid cell-specific domain with preferential sensitivity to DNase I perfectly co-localize with the borders of β-globin gene domain marked by insulators. </plain></SENT>
