</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perinatal health outcomes are considered important indicators of future child and adult health (Perera et al., 2007; Stillerman et al., 2008; Woodruff et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Globally, adverse birth outcomes rank among the top 10 causes for disability-adjusted life years (Murray &amp; Lopez, 1997; World Health Organization, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 2009–2010, the annual burden of adverse perinatal outcomes for Canada were 18 302 preterm births, 1167 infant deaths, 19 097 small-for-gestational age singleton infants, 1613 fetal deaths and 11 441 congenital anomalies (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Various factors including maternal nutrition, environmental contaminant exposures and socioeconomic factors have been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (Abu-Saad &amp; Fraser, 2010; Alsuwaida et al., 2011; Gelson &amp; Johnson, 2010; Jolly et al., 2000; Mathews et al., 1999; Sharnkardass et al., 2014; Wigle et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Very young and advanced maternal ages have been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes (Chantrapanichkul &amp; Chawanpaiboon, 2013; Kenny et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Also, maternal smoking is implicated in miscarriage, perinatal mortality, birth defects, low birth weight and premature births (Hackshaw et al., 2011; Howe et al., 2012; Stangl et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two measures that are typically considered in assessment of the quality of an infant’s development are birth weight and gestational age at delivery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Low birth weight is defined as &lt;2500 g (JAMA, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Several chronic health consequences in adulthood such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with low birth weight, meanwhile high birth weight is associated with cancer (Curhan et al., 1996; Ross, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Normal term pregnancy is expected to last between 37 and 41 completed weeks, while preterm birth is defined as live birth before 37 weeks (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Low birth weight can be due to preterm birth or intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR), or a combination of the two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The most common measure of IUGR is small-for-gestational age (SGA) generally defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age for a reference population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Two proposed mechanistic pathways for these perinatal outcomes are oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Elevated circulating levels of vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and high blood pressure (BP) in pregnancy are related to IUGR and low birth weight (Arslan et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased risk of future cardiovascular disease was associated with maternal and neonatal complications in pregnancy (Stangl et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Similarly, maternal hypertension is implicated in increased risk of adverse cardiovascular health in offspring, later in childhood (Lawlor et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress plays a role in maternal and foetal morbidity (Bell et al., 2007; Cindrova-Davies, 2009; Gitto et al., 2002; Tabacova et al., 1998; Triche &amp; Hossain, 2007), in pre-eclampsia (Burton &amp; Jauniaux, 2004) and in preterm delivery (Ferguson et al., 2015a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For instance, environmental exposures to phthalates are associated with increased oxidative stress markers such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (Guo et al., 2014) and 8-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF-2α) (Ferguson et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Watkins et al., 2015) in pregnant women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in vitro exposure of placental cells to phthalates resulted in oxidative stress-related DNA damage (Tetz et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Exposure to air pollutants, which can trigger oxidative stress, has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes (Olsson et al., 2013; Tabacova, 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although there have been a few reports on a limited number of maternal markers and their association with IUGR, a meta-analysis suggested the need for incorporation of biophysical and maternal clinical characteristics along with maternal biomarkers when testing for such associations in order to meet the requirements of a clinically useful predictive test (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Identification of maternal biochemical pathways relevant to birth outcomes can shed light on intervention strategies to improve future child health. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The goal of this work was to gain insight into maternal vascular mechanisms during pregnancy that potentially influenced infant birth weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we analysed the third trimester plasma of a subset of mothers from a mother-infant cohort (The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals – MIREC) study for molecular markers relevant to maternal vascular health including some that are considered as prognostic factors of cardiovascular diseases (e.g. endothelins). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Our results from this mother-infant cohort study provide interesting and useful preliminary information on maternal biomarkers associated with infant birth weight and gestational age (37–41 weeks). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>These subsets of MIREC study subjects (Table 1) appeared to portray the MIREC study population in terms of the distribution of infant birth weight, gestational age and infant birth weight to gestational age ratio values (Figure 1) and also in terms of their maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Maternal circulating endothelins (ET-1 and ET-3), cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2) exhibited positive associations (p &lt; 0.05) and clustered together in all groups (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Elevated circulating endothelins are linked to endothelial dysfunction (Bátkai et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>It has been reported previously that MMP-2 can cleave precursors of mature peptides ET-1 (e.g. BET-1) and ET-3 (Fernandez-Patron et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The correlation analysis results reveal that MMP-2 is negatively associated to BET-1 and positively associated to ET-1 (Supplemental Table 1) which supports the notion that the conversion of BET-1 to the potent vasoactive peptide ET-1 can be a result of elevated MMP-2 levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>It was interesting to note that the lipid oxidation marker 8-isoPGF-2α (ISOP), a marker of oxidative stress, was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This is in line with previous reports linking oxidative stress and endothelinergic system (Kahler et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Also, the lipid oxidation marker was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with maternal BMI, while a negative trend was seen (not significant) with infant birth weight and gestational age. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses also revealed that BET-1, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3 exhibited a negative relationship (not significant) with infant birth weight (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, maternal plasma ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3 were found to exhibit a positive correlation (not significant) with maternal blood pressure values (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>These observations imply that alteration of maternal endothelin homeostasis may influence infant birth weight probably by negatively impacting on maternal blood pressure, and thus possibly intrauterine perfusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Elevated ET-1 levels and high blood pressure in pregnant women have been shown to cause intrauterine growth restriction that result in low infant birth weights (Arslan et al., 2004), consistent with our findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The ET-2 peptide, similar to ET-1, binds to the ET[A] receptor and mediates vasoconstriction (Schneider et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The infusion of ET-3 in rats is known to cause a dose-dependent increase in diastolic pressure (Tabrizchi &amp; Triggle, 1991). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Our regression analyses revealed that infant birth weight was related to a combination of maternal plasma markers (Table 2 and Figure 3A–C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Of these maternal factors related to birth outcomes, some were common to both IBW and IBW-GA distributions (Figure 3A–C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both best subsets and polytomous logistic regression analyses yielded similar results for both IBW distributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In essence, regression analysis of all data collectively suggested that infant birth weight outcome can be associated with the third trimester maternal plasma markers endothelins, ISOP, cellular adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MMP-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>All these maternal plasma markers are implicated in endothelial cell activation, vascular remodeling, oxidative stress and inflammation (Fernandez-Patron et al., 2001; Szmitko et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The clarity in terms of maternal mechanisms was gained when the &lt;25th percentile and &gt;75th percentile groups at both ends of the IBW and IBW-GA distributions were analysed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>For instance, across the different approaches in general, low birth weight was consistently associated with elevated maternal plasma BET-1, ET-2 and MMP-9 levels (Table 2 and Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high birth weight was linked to elevated VEGF levels (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that with the &lt;25th percentile group (low birth weight), vasoconstriction pathways may be active, whereas with the &gt;75th percentile group (high birth weight), vasodilation and angiogenesis mechanisms appear to be active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor is known to be linked to endothelial NO production and has been associated with enhanced utero-placental perfusion (Valdes et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The oxidative stress marker 8-isoPGF-2α (ISOP) was a constituent marker in the model only for the &lt;25th percentile group from the IBW distribution analysis (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This observation is in line with oxidative stress being implicated in low infant birth weight (Fleischer et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gestational age at birth appeared to be influenced by ET-1, MMP-2 and VEGF based on both regression analyses (Table 2 and Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In a previous report by Tency et al. (2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>MMPs have been linked to inflammation and are associated with preterm labor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Levels of ET-1 and ET-2 were reported previously to be increased in the amniotic fluid of women with preterm labor and microbial infection of the amniotic cavity (Romero et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) conducted on the maternal plasma markers (expression fold change) for the &lt;25th percentile and  &gt;75th percentile groups versus the control groups (25th–75th percentile) yielded two primary networks (Figure 5A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The protein network 1 associated with the low birth weight group (&lt;25th percentile) was related to cardiovascular disease pathway (highest score), especially hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that in this network ET-1 (EDN1) and MMP-9 are upregulated (Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>As mentioned before, increased ET-1 is implicated in gestational hypertension (Arslan et al., 2004) and increased MMP-9 is seen in women with preterm labor (Tency et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the network 2 (Figure 5B) associated with high birth weight group (&gt;75th percentile) was related to inflammatory disease pathway (highest score) with increased CRP (red), down-regulated MMP-9 (green) and interaction seen between ET-1 and ET[B] receptor (EDNRB), where ET-1 potentially binds to ET[B] receptor and can upregulate VEGF (red), as seen under hypoxic condition (Spinella et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Also, our current observations are consistent with our previous findings by high-content proteomic analyses of third trimester plasma from a small subset of mothers from the MIREC cohort where protein interaction networks of inflammation and cardiovascular effects were activated in mothers of low birth weight infants (Kumarathasan et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>One of the limitations associated with this study is the small sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this work could have benefited from high-content maternal biomarker analyses, and Doppler assessment for information on utero-placental blood flow. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores identification of potential maternal biomarkers relevant to lower or higher infant birth weight by integration of multiple maternal plasma markers of key biochemical mechanisms with related maternal physiological parameters (e.g. BP) as an intermediate outcome and pregnancy outcome as a clinical outcome (e.g. IBW), in combination with categorization for regression analyses performed at different levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that low infant birth weight is conceivably predominantly influenced by vasoconstrictive and inflammatory mechanisms, while vasodilation pathways can potentially lead to high infant birth weights. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Even though some maternal biomarkers (e.g. VCAM-1, Figure 3B and C) can appear to be similar to both these infant birth weight groups, the characteristics of related molecular interactions and associated downstream mechanisms can be responsible for orchestrating the different birth outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the report by Wei et al. (2003) where an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, an inflammatory disease in children, was associated with both low and high birth weights, but different molecular phenotypes were shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Also, pre-eclampsia has been associated with both low and high birth weight babies, suggesting at least two different subsets of patients with pre-eclampsia (Xiong et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Candidate biomarkers of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation identified in this study, especially using established markers of vascular function, the circulating endothelins as anchors, can be useful in future screening of maternal–infant study cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In addition, these maternal markers are also implicated in uteroplacental insufficiency and angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This work thus warrants future high-content “proteomic and metabolomic” biomarker analysis in combination with analysis of upstream regulatory events using a systems biology approach for in-depth mechanistic information, especially to identify different molecular phenotypes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that maternal molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature and inflammation can play a role by affecting vascular remodelling and function in pregnant mothers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>This can translate into maternal blood pressure changes (intermediary maternal health outcome) as well as impact on uteroplacental blood flow changes and angiogenesis, and thus can adversely impact on birth outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Low and high birth weight outcomes can be due to underlying maternal mechanistic pathways namely, vasoconstriction and vasodilation processes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>These observations imply that future work using systems biology to integrate multiple maternal plasma “OMIC” markers with maternal physiological parameters can advance the understanding of adverse birth outcome pathways. </plain></SENT>
