</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HIV infections continue to rise in the UK, particularly amongst MSM and the reduction of new infections is a key component of the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recent reports on sexual health highlight the need to invest more in HIV prevention strategies [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The Community HIV and AIDS prevention (CHAPS) policy (led by the Terrence Higgins Trust) identifies post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual exposure (PEPSE) to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as one method of preventing HIV infection in the UK [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recommendations for treatment are derived from the existing use of antiretrovirals to prevent HIV infection after high risk occupational exposure to the virus ('needle-stick injuries') [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recommendations for prescribing PEP result from the clinician's assessment of risk of transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>If the risk of HIV transmission through particular sexual practices (such as unprotected anal intercourse) is of a similar magnitude as occupational exposures then PEP should be recommended [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that PEP may reduce the risk of HIV infection if given within 72 hours and adhered to rigorously for 28 days [5,7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Sustained adherence is required to prevent treatment failure, however, non-adherence of a quarter to a third of those prescribed PEP has been reported [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The treatment can be challenging to patients due to side-effects such as diarrhoea, nausea, headaches and vomiting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The treatment is also costly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the group most affected by the HIV epidemic in the UK [11] and their sexual risk taking behaviour is reported to be increasing [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>As part of a comprehensive strategy across HIV prevention and care, behavioural interventions remain an important tool in the global fight against HIV [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>One-to-one behavioural interventions, such as motivational interviewing (MI) have been recommended [15,16] to reduce HIV in high risk groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>NICE guidance places recommendations for one-to-one interventions within the context of current STI/HIV service provision [1,17] and states that these interventions are integral to the modernisation of sexual health services [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Seeking PEP after potential sexual exposure may indicate an unmet prevention need and provides an opportunity to target interventions thus potentially lowering the likelihood of further risk behaviour [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We will implement a telephone-administered intervention based on motivational interviewing (MI) augmented with information and behavioural skills building (informed by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>MI is defined as a 'directive, client-centred counselling style for eliciting behaviour change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence' [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>It is may be especially effective for individuals who are reluctant to change or who are ambivalent about changing their behaviour and may be particularly appropriate for MSM who may require a more tailored preventive strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs shows that MI outperforms traditional advice giving in the treatment of a range of behavioural problems and diseases [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>More recently, a pilot study has shown the effectiveness of telephone administered MI to reduce risky sexual behaviour in HIV infected rural populations [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The study will examine whether a two-session, telephone administered augmented motivational interviewing intervention based on the IMB model (Figure 1) reduces risky sexual behaviour (compared with 'treatment as usual'), in MSM prescribed PEP treatment after potential sexual exposure to HIV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) approach could be used to explain sexual risk taking behaviour [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the IMB model has been shown to provide a good basis for understanding and predicting HIV-relevant health behaviour and health behaviour change in almost two decades of research [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>This model further proposes that information relevant to the personal practice of preventive behaviour, motivation to practice prevention and behavioural skills for practicing prevention effectively, are fundamental determinants of HIV/STI preventive behaviour [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The IMB model proposes an intervention development process involving (1) elicitation of client resources and needs and, (2) matching intervention content to existing need and behaviour change objectives, (3) implementation of information, motivation and skill development techniques interventions according to protocol and, finally, (4) evaluation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The IMB has yet to be applied to a short term prophylactic regimen of medication after risky sexual exposure but its previous successful application to HIV risk reduction suggests that it is an appropriate model on which to base an intervention for those prescribed PEP. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the protocol of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of motivational interviewing augmented with information and behavioural skills building (informed by the Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills Model), over and above usual care, on risky sexual behaviour in MSM prescribed PEP after potential sexual exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim of this research is to examine the impact of the intervention on adherence to PEP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>This study will also provide estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention through the inclusion of an economic evaluation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>One of the strengths of this study is that the intervention is targeting individuals who may be deemed as high risk: those who have presented for PEP treatment after a potential sexual exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the group most affected by the HIV epidemic in the UK [11] and their sexual risk taking behaviour is reported to be increasing [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>As part of a comprehensive strategy across HIV prevention and care, behavioural interventions remain an important tool in the global fight against HIV [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>One-to-one behavioural interventions, such as motivational interviewing (MI) have been recommended [15,16] to reduce HIV in high risk groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Although the intervention is tailored to the individual, our proposed intervention is manualised so that the content delivered will be similar and based on the principles of MI with the underlying change mechanisms specified by the IMB Model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>As part of this study a manual has been developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Specific behaviour change techniques used will then be able to be identified and quantified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Translating effective behavioural change interventions from the research setting to clinical practice can be facilitated better when treatment fidelity strategies are used as guidelines for implementing new interventions in clinical contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We will be monitoring the reliability and validity of the intervention which is an additional strength of the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>A recent review [14] highlighted that the recruitment of MSM participants was the most challenging aspect of similar behavioural intervention studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>To overcome these barriers we are employing strategies to ensure that recruitment and retention are maximised, including: the refinement of assessment materials with the MSM community; the use of a telephone-based intervention to overcome geographic boundaries, time constraints and fear of public exposure as an MSM; the recruitment of individuals seeking PEP rather than the recruitment of high risk individuals from the community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This study will identify whether it is appropriate and cost-effective to intervene using a tailored intervention of one-to-one telephone calls with MSM prescribed the prophylactic treatment regimen after potential sexual exposure to HIV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>If the intervention is effective, further work will be needed on training staff to deliver the intervention competently. </plain></SENT>
