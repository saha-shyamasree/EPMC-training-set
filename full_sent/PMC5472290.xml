</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5% of children have some form of disability; globally 95 million children aged 14 or under are believed to have a disability [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the United Kingdom (UK) 800,000 children and young people have a disability [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Mobility impairment is one of the leading causes of disability [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The National Health Service (NHS) is the largest supplier of wheelchairs and mobility aids in the UK, supporting over 1.2 million people with long-term mobility needs [4], around 70,000 of which are children [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Independent mobility offers a range of holistic benefits for children with impaired mobility, including functional mobility improvement [6], psychosocial development [7], increased independence [8] and reduced pain and deformity [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Appropriate wheelchair interventions are key to improving the outcomes of children with impaired mobility, including their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>HRQoL is the perceived impact of health status on quality of life (QoL), including physical, psychological and social functioning [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Varni et al [11] found that, of the chronic conditions they evaluated, cerebral palsy had the most significant impact on the HRQoL of children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Vargus-Adams [12] and Dobhal et al [13] found that cerebral palsy predominantly impacts child HRQoL in the domains of physical function, physical independence, mobility and social integration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Wheelchair provision has been found to improve quality of life (QoL) [5,14] and more specifically HRQoL [15], however further research is required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Quality-adjusted life year framework </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides independent, evidence-based guidance to the NHS to inform healthcare funding allocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>At present there is limited robust economic evidence to inform NHS wheelchair provision and the design of NHS wheelchair services in an evidence-based manner [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Likewise, published evidence of paediatric wheelchair effectiveness tends to lack methodological quality [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Evidence-based decision-making requires robust evidence of cost-effectiveness to ensure that limited resources are used in a way that maximises potential benefits for patients [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>NICE recommend the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as a primary outcome measure in cost-effectiveness analysis [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>QALYs represent an aggregate score of quantity and quality of life; they are calculated by multiplying the amount of time spent in a given health state by the relative societal preference for that health state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Due to their generic nature, QALYs can be used to compare disparate interventions and patient groups [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Health state preferences, or utilities, are derived from preference-based measures of HRQoL, therefore in order to calculate QALYs, robust preference-based HRQoL data is required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Preference-based health-related quality of life measurement </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Preference-based approaches to HRQoL measurement are distinct as each combination of answers, representing a specific health state, is assigned a utility weight derived from the social desirability of that state, for instance ranging from death (0) to perfect health (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Health state preferences are usually elicited from a large sample of the general population, and thus results reveal societal preferences for configurations of health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>NICE stipulate that in the calculation of QALYs, preference weights must derive from a representative general population sample as societal resources should be allocated in a way that is relevant to the general population [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>There is considerable debate regarding the use of patient or public preferences for health state valuation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>When assessing the desirability of hypothetical health states, individuals focus on the transition from their own health state to the hypothetical health state, and thus general population beliefs about the impact of disease and disability do not always reflect the lived experience [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>When disability is presented to a member of the general public in the form of a hypothetical health state, the focus on personal transition means that processes of adaptation to health states are not accounted for, and thus there is a misunderstanding of the lived experience of disability [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Versteegh and Brouwer [22] state that differences in patient and public health state preferences reveal important information about perceived QoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>They conclude that both patient and general public preferences are valid sources of health state utilities, and therefore cost per QALY estimates should be calculated from the utility weights of both groups where possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Applying methods of economic evaluation to wheelchair interventions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To date a small number of economic analyses of wheelchair interventions have been conducted [25–29], however these tend to lack methodological quality and nearly all focus on adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Evidently there is a need for more high quality robust economic evidence, and appropriate data collection methods, to facilitate an evidence based approach to paediatric wheelchair provision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Some existing assistive technology outcome measures do approximate HRQoL measurement to a certain extent, for instance the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) has been found to be a robust psychosocial impact measure for assistive technology users [30], but it is neither preference-based nor directly measuring HRQoL constructs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>NICE and the QALY framework have become increasingly influential in UK healthcare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to generate data which adheres to NICE guidelines to ensure that it is comparable and informative in decisions about healthcare funding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This requires an understanding of how to apply methods of QALY calculation in specific contexts, such as paediatric wheelchair provision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>This first requires an understanding of how young wheelchair users define HRQoL in relation to mobility impairment and wheelchair use (i.e. mobility-related QoL) in order to assess the appropriateness of NICE approved HRQoL measures, such as the EuroQoL Five Dimension (EQ-5D) [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Factors such as independence, socialisation, acceptance and integration are of particular importance to wheelchair users [8,14,32–34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The ability of commonly used generic HRQoL outcome measures to accurately capture these domains in this specific population is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>There are currently no preference-based approaches to measuring HRQoL which have been developed specifically for use in mobility-impaired populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, generic preference-based measures appear to have limited sensitivity in the context of mobility impairment [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Previous researchers have resorted to amending the wording of the EQ-5D to increase relevance to people who use wheelchairs [36]; although pragmatic, this is not a valid use of such measures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Data were collected through qualitative semi-structured interviews with young wheelchair users (≤18 years), their parent(s) or dyads of young wheelchair users and their parent(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Qualitative Framework analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Qualitative Framework analysis is a popular approach in health-related research as it can be used to meet specific information needs [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Deductive a priori methods allows specific themes and issues to be examined in targeted populations using pre-specified aims and objectives [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In the context of health-related research this allows researchers to focus on a particular area of interest or phenomena, whilst maintaining systematic and transparent processes [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The study reported in this paper was part of a larger programme of research called the Wheels Project (funded by the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research PhD Studentship award), which also included a systematic review [16], quantitative assessment of HRQoL (paper in preparation) and a pilot discrete choice experiment questionnaire [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This paper presents only the qualitative findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This study was granted ethical approval by the North West Wales NHS research ethics committee (reference: 13/WA/0143) and an academic ethics committee at Bangor University. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this paper ‘child’ is defined as anyone aged 18 or under. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that a child is any person under the age of 18 years [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Individuals aged up to 18 years were included in this research to be inclusive of individuals transitioning from child to adult wheelchair services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Although it is somewhat problematic to refer to teenagers and young adults as ‘children’, using a single term improves clarity within the paper. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted in participants’ homes, guided by an interview schedule (S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The interview schedule was piloted with a small sample (N = 10) of young wheelchair users (aged 11 to 18) at a children’s wheelchair charity beneficiary meeting in order to gauge their understanding of the questions and to refine the wording. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Each interview lasted for around an hour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The interview schedule was developed from a number of sources: the findings of a previous systematic review [16]; discussion within the research team; and with consideration of the EQ-5D-Y and HUI HRQoL measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The questions facilitated participants to consider how they define HRQoL in relation to wheelchair use and mobility impairment, and to reflect on the ability of standard HRQoL measures to represent this definition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This included asking participants to discuss the domains and levels of the EQ-5D-Y and HUI measures in relation to their own definition of HRQoL. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D-Y and HUI measures were used to frame the interviews as they are two of the most commonly used generic preference-based HRQoL measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D is recommended by NICE for use in cost-effectiveness analysis [44], and the HUI was the only preference-based HRQoL measure designed specifically for use in children and adolescents at the time of designing the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D-Y measures HRQoL using five domains: mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain and discomfort; and anxiety and depression [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D was originally developed for use in adult populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>A child version, the EQ-5D-Y, has been validated for proxy reporting from age four [45] and child self-reporting from age eight [46]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We approached this research from an extra-welfarist, societal and social model of disability perspective, underpinned by principles of disability equality and utility theory. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The social model of disability postulates that people with impairments become disabled as a result of social oppression and discrimination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Disability is therefore defined as being a direct result of societal barriers to participation and independence imposed on people with impairments [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This theoretical position necessitated a broader view of disability and impairment in this study, looking beyond traditional medical definitions of health and disability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Thus, we focussed on a wide range of topics in the interviews and analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Utility theory underpins popular methods of economic evaluation in healthcare, such as QALYs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Although <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/utility.html">utility</ext-link> cannot be derived directly, it is possible to rank different health states in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/order.html">order</ext-link> of societal preference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the acceptable cost of a healthcare service or intervention is related to the marginal utility gains it provides. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Extra-welfarism is a normative approach to the analysis of health and healthcare, which includes outcomes such as individual utility, happiness, social interaction and pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This approach is relevant to health as the development of public healthcare systems reflects the need to allocate resources fairly and efficiently within financial constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The QALY approach has a basis in extra-welfarism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Utility theory and extra-welfarism underpin the QALY framework, therefore because we focused on the use of HRQoL data for economic evaluation purposes, these theories informed our understanding of HRQoL and the data we sought to collect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The study reported in this paper was underpinned by an overarching conceptual framework developed as part of a previous systematic review [16]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>Participants defined mobility-related QoL through three distinct but interrelated concepts: participation and positive experiences; self-worth and feeling fulfilled; and health and functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>Children and parents showed general consensus, however parents of younger children placed greater emphasis on health and functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>The domains of HRQoL defined by standard HRQoL measures (such as the EQ-5D-Y and HUI) are to some extent applicable to children with mobility impairments, however important considerations of participation, positive experiences and self-worth related to mobility-impairment are not accounted for. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>Furthermore available responses on these measures are not sufficiently sensitive in this context due to a focus on normative functioning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>Generic preference-based HRQoL measures are scored using health state preferences derived from the general public, which may be problematic in this context as the preference of an able-bodied person for a state of immobility is almost certainly going to be low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="444" pm="."><plain>However, as stated by participants in this study and others, inability to walk does not necessarily discount HRQoL [50,51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="445" pm="."><plain>This is a key distinction to make when considering the use of general population value sets in disabled populations: preferences will always be for a state of ability rather than disability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the social model of disability, it is fundamentally wrong to apply an able-bodied perspective to a disabled phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>Commonly used preference-based HRQoL measures, such as the EQ-5D-Y and HUI, are potentially not fit for purpose in this population, as subsequent utility scores reflect a general population perception of HRQoL rather than the perceptions of people living with mobility impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>Although this is representative of the wider societal view of the health states, it is not representative of the population that was intended to be studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the solution is to think beyond generic QALYs and clinical effectiveness, and to consider mobility specific approaches to HRQoL measurement, or to use relevant patient preferences for health states [22,52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>In circumstances where generic measures lack sensitivity, condition-specific approaches to QALY calculation can be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>Preference-based condition-specific HRQoL measures have been developed successfully in areas such as visual impairment [53], dementia [54] and epilepsy [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this paper support the need to develop a preference-based mobility-related QoL outcome measure which could be used to accurately measure utility gains associated with mobility interventions in disabled populations, for both children and adults. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>One of the key findings was the importance of independence in defining and enhancing HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>Wheelchair provision should enable and sustain independence [56], and promote physical, cognitive and social development [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="455" pm="."><plain>Without the ability to move independently children are unable to have full control over their social interactions and their ability to participate in activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, without appropriate access to enable independent movement children are restricted in their ability to socialise and participate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="457" pm="."><plain>Children and parents seek an appropriate level of independence relative to the child’s abilities, and this relates to removing barriers that oppose independence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="458" pm="."><plain>Wiart et al [8] found that mothers believed that wheelchairs enabled their child to take part in age-appropriate activities and reduced their need for assistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="459" pm="."><plain>Likewise, Evans et al [34] found that after provision of a PWC children experienced increased independence, which led to increased socialisation and participation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="460" pm="."><plain>Traditional functional abilities such as walking and basic self-care were not widely used to define mobility-related QoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="461" pm="."><plain>Instead participants focussed on mobility by other means (such as wheelchairs) and ability to adapt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="462" pm="."><plain>This indicates that positive abilities and functioning are much broader than traditional definitions, such as simply being able to walk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="463" pm="."><plain>Several participants stated that children with impaired mobility can achieve a QoL on par with an able-bodied child if the correct adaptations are in place to facilitate this, although this could not be replicated on the either the EQ-5D-Y or HUI measures using their current descriptive systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="464" pm="."><plain>Children and parents of older children used terms such as happiness and emotional wellbeing less frequently than parents of younger children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>This suggests a difference in QoL perspectives associated with age, as nebulous terms such as happiness become replaced with specific activities or functioning which provide happiness and wellbeing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="466" pm="."><plain>The role of health and function in defining QoL was of key importance to parents of younger children, but was less important for older children and their parents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>This reflects previous evidence which found that parents of children with impaired mobility go through a process of learning to accept the changing mobility and equipment needs of their child [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D was not originally designed for use in children, and although the youth version has been validated in younger age groups, the domains and levels of the descriptive system were not designed specifically around the testimony of children, let alone people with disabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>Child-specific measures of HRQoL, such as the CHU-9D, [58] are now available, although additional research is needed to verify their applicability for children with disabilities more generally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>An important consideration is whether generic measures are appropriate in populations where health and QoL is likely to fluctuate or degenerate rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>For instance, if HRQoL fluctuates on a day-to-day basis due to changing functional abilities, or if health decreases rapidly in a short space of time, then basing HRQoL estimates on a single time point could cause validity and reliability issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>Likewise, if regular retests were used to counter this then the measure would need to be highly sensitive to change over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>HRQoL measures tend to be comprised of relatively simple descriptive systems, which may be insufficiently sensitive to detect rapid change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>In this respect a patient-generated outcome measure could prove to be more efficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>From a clinical perspective this would be an informative approach to measuring effect, however from a health economics perspective patient-generated outcomes lack genericity for utility measurement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>Each individual would have very specific needs and priorities, thus making comparisons between people and groups difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it would not be possible to generate a generic health state preference for every possible scenario. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>Likewise, identifying preferences at the individual level would prove too time consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Generic or condition-specific measures with higher sensitivity are required, for instance a preference based mobility-related QoL outcome measure developed through consultation with people with mobility impairments and validated in children. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>There was general consensus that disabilities acquired later in life would have a greater impact on HRQoL than congenital mobility impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>This correlates with the perception that HRQoL is defined by personal ability, and thus a change in that ability detrimentally impacts HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>The important factor is thus the baseline level of ability and the ability to cope with subsequent change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>Focusing on ‘normal’ functioning can potentially detrimentally impact wheelchair users, as their HRQoL may in fact be increased by reducing walking and favouring wheelchair mobility due to pain related to walking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>This reflects Sen’s theory of capability, which differentiates achieved functionings and capabilities; focussing simply on achieved functioning presupposes optimal capabilities [59]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec027"><title><text><SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>Strengths and limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>A quarter of the interviews were conducted with the parent and child present at the same time, which may have influenced both parent and child answers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>Most participating children were aged 16 or over (72.7%) and thus this study potentially misses the perspectives of younger wheelchair users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>There were inherent problems with including young children in the interviews due to parental concern, child ability and communication skills. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>Future research would benefit from focusing on younger children and utilising a greater array of child friendly research methods to elicit responses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>It is important to consider the transferability, credibility, confirmability and dependability of the results [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>Due to the study demographics and the relatively small sample size it is difficult to judge whether these results are transferable to other comparative settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>The sample is potentially not representative of the wider population of young wheelchair users, as the demographics show over-representation of children with cerebral palsy from relatively high-income families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>We have provided a clear and thorough breakdown of participant demographics to give specific context for these results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>The analytical themes generated from the interviews are reflective of the opinions expressed by participants, highlighted by the illustrative quotes throughout this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>The interview schedule was reviewed after each interview so that we could be reflexive to new and emerging themes; only minor amendments were required in practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>Due to time constraints participants were not involved in analysis and did not have the opportunity to verify transcripts, which potentially may have affected the credibility of the findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>However, all interviews were transcribed verbatim and double-checked for errors prior to formal analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>The use of Framework Analysis allowed for a transparent and flexible approach to the data analysis, however, the a priori nature of the framework likely produced different results than a more inductive process might have. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>It is good practice for multiple researchers to code interview transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>However, as this research was carried out as part of a PhD studentship, funding and time was limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="501" pm="."><plain>Therefore, coding was only carried out by one researcher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>To increase consistency and maintain validity, the data were widely discussed within the wider research team to help shape interpretations and analyses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Young wheelchair users and their parents defined mobility-related QoL through three distinct but interrelated analytical themes: participation and positive experiences; self-worth and feeling fulfilled; and health and functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of economic evaluation it appears that generic preference-based measures of HRQoL lack sensitivity to elicit reliable utility data from children with mobility impairments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>Future economic research in this field must consider alternative approaches to utility measurement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>Child-specific preference-based utility should be used as a basis for cost-utility analysis at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>This requires additional research to understand the applicability of measures such as the CHU-9D in disabled populations, and potentially the development of mobility-related utility measures. </plain></SENT>
