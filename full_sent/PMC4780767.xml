</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The four mammalian neurotrophins comprise a family of related secreted factors required for differentiation, survival, development and death of specific populations of neurons and non-neuronal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The effects of the neurotrophins are mediated by binding to TrkA, TrkB and TrkC receptor tyrosine kinases and to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Trk receptors play critical roles mediating neuronal survival and growth and are important modulators of synaptic function [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>p75NTR is a component of distinct cell surface signaling platforms that function to induce apoptosis and mediate neuronal growth inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, p75NTR also acts as a Trk co-receptor that increases the binding specificity and affinity of Trk receptors for neurotrophins [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Neurotrophins are produced as proforms of approximately 240 amino acids that are cleaved by furins and proconvertases to yield mature neurotrophins of about 120 amino acids [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The main functions ascribed to the neurotrophin prodomain include facilitating neurotrophin folding and directing neurotrophins to the regulated secretory pathway [4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have indicated that nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are secreted from cells as prodomain-containing forms (proNGF and proBDNF, respectively) [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In some types of primary neurons and in endothelial cells, proneurotrophin binding to the p75NTR-sortilin receptor complex is a potent apoptotic stimulus [7, 9, 10] and several studies have demonstrated the importance of proNGF and proBDNF for inducing apoptosis in vivo [7, 10–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Further, several groups have reported that proBDNF functions as an important modulator of synaptic structure and function [16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although it seems certain that the pro-neurotrophins play physiological roles, the precise signaling pathways that are regulated by these ligands remain uncertain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recent data have shown that another VPS10 family member, SORCS2, functions as a p75NTR binding partner that acts in a pro-neurotrophin binding complex [18] but the precise signaling cascades and cell biological responses evoked downstream of the p75NTR-sortilin or the p75NTR-SorCS2 complexes remain largely uncharacterized. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Details of proBDNF signaling and cell biology have been slow to emerge, in part due to a lack of robust tools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>p75NTR is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and several major findings on receptors of this class have relied on the development of tagged ligands that can be used to identify and track receptor complexes in cell biological assays [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel tagged proBDNF isoform that can be easily purified and readily used for tandem affinity purification or for ligand-labeling approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This reagent exhibits normal biological activity and can be used to isolate proBDNF receptor complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We believe it will prove helpful in the characterization of proBDNF signaling mechanisms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Using a two-step purification procedure (streptavidin pulldown of the biotinylated HBpF-proBDNF then cleavage of the construct by the PreScission™ Protease), we established that HBpF-proBDNF can bind to a complex of p75NTR and sortilin when they are overexpressed in HEK293 cells and it interacts with endogenous p75NTR and SorCS2 in PC12 cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Epitope tagged ligands have proven to be valuable tools for analyzing receptor complexes, especially in the TNF receptor superfamily field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>For example, early studies employed ligands tagged with a single FLAG or Fc tag [24, 25] showed that TNF receptor I-mediated apoptosis occurs through activation of two sequential signaling complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>More recent studies, using tagging procedures similar to that described here, resulted in the identification of LUBAC, a receptor-associated linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex [19, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Hence HBpF-proBDNF will be a useful reagent for identifying proBDNF receptor complexes and for unraveling specific signaling mechanisms that mediate the various physiological functions of proBDNF. </plain></SENT>
