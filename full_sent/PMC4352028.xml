</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transfer RNA (tRNA) is known to undergo extensive modification of nucleobases, including uridines at position 34, which represents the first base of the anticodon that can engage in non-canonical base pairing (wobbling) with the third base of the codon (reviewed in [1]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wobble uridines (U34) in the anticodons from 11 tRNA species were shown to undergo modification to either 5-methoxy-carbonyl-methyl-uridine (mcm5), 5-carbamoyl-methyl-uridine (ncm5), carbamoylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine (ncm5Um) or 5-methoxy-carbonyl-methyl-2-thio-uridine (mcm5s2U) [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of the side chains mcm5 and ncm5 requires the Elongator complex (Elp1-Elp6) as well as factors involved in interaction with and modification of Elongator (Kti11-Kti13; Sit4, Sap180/Sap195; Hrr25/Kti14) [2, 4–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Formation of mcm5, but not ncm5 further requires a methyltransferase complex (Trm9/Trm112) [14–16] and removal of the latter results in the replacement of mcm5 side chains on wobble uridines with ncm5 [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Wobble uridine thiolation, which is required for completed formation of the mcm5s2 modification in tRNALys UUU, tRNAGln UUG and tRNAGlu UUC, appears to occur independently of mcm5 formation on the same base. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, Elongator mutants were shown to accumulate s2U [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mutants lacking components of the sulfur transfer system required for U34 thiolation (Urm1, Uba4, Ncs2, Ncs6) no longer form mcm5s2U but instead show elevated levels of mcm5U, suggesting that the pathways required for modifying U34 at position 2 and 5 operate, at least in part, independently of each other [17, 10, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Elongator mutants or thiolation-minus cells have been shown to exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including, but not restricted to, elevated resistance to fungal anticodon nuclease toxins, cell cycle delay, slow growth at 30°C, thermosensitivity and sensitivity to various exogenous stresses [18–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role in sulfur transfer to tRNA, Urm1 itself can act as a ubiquitin like protein and becomes covalently conjugated to target proteins, a process termed urmylation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that the combination of elp3 and ncs6 mutations (resulting in the simultaneous loss of both, mcm5 chain formation and s2 thiolation) causes synthetic lethality and inviability in S. cerevisiae [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Importantly, inviability could be suppressed by overexpression of tRNALys UUU, which normally carries mcm5s2U, but completely lacks U34 modifications in the background of the elp3ncs6 double mutant [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inviability was interpreted to result from a specific decoding deficiency of tRNALys UUU that is caused by the lack of wobble uridine modification and can be countered and partly compensated for by excess of the hypomodified tRNALys UUU [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Further genetic experiments revealed that mcm5 and mcm5s2 modifications in general can be regarded as factors improving the decoding efficiency of tRNAs in ways that involve canonical and non-canonical anticodon-codon base pairing [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In line with a decoding defect underlying phenotypes of mcm5/ncm5U or s2U modification mutants, not only are synthetic genetic interactions between Elongator minus and thiolation minus mutations suppressible by tRNA overexpression, but also single mutant growth phenotypes can be rescued by excess of tRNALys UUU and tRNAGln UUG [24, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Individual loss of mcm5/ncm5 modification or thiolation pathways may affect tRNA decoding and translational efficiency in a codon dependent fashion, since the mcm5s2 modified tRNAs (tRNALys UUU, tRNAGln UUG and tRNAGlu UUC) are thought to be mainly involved in decoding of the A-ending codons for lysine (AAA), glutamine (CAA) and glutamic acid (GAA) but not the G-ending ones [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Consistently, a genome wide study in S. cerevisiae recently confirmed major negative effects of elp3 and urm1 single mutations on the translatability of transcripts enriched for A-ending codons [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, an independent study by Zinshteyn and Gilbert [28] claimed these effects were too minor to affect global protein outputs, though a slowdown of translation at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons in the absence of mcm5/ncm5 or s2U was also confirmed by the authors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These studies on the role of mcm5s2U in S. cerevisiae, however, are hampered by the thought that complete removal of mcm5s2U is not tolerated and results in inviability, hence the effects on translation and phenotypes in the full absence of mcm5s2U could not be studied yet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We show here, that in the reference strain isogenic to S. cerevisiae S288C, complete removal of the U34 wobble modification mcm5s2 is tolerated at the expense of a growth defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Further, the strain lacking mcm5s2U yields reduced total protein levels, pointing to a translational defect which likely accounts for the growth-related phenotypes, for both can be suppressed by excess levels of hypomodified tRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Since overexpression of tRNALys UUU alone has significant suppressor effects, malfunction of this tRNA is mainly responsible for phenotypes induced by complete loss of mcm5s2U. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To test the effect of simultaneous removal of wobble uridine mcm5/ncm5 side chain formation and thiolation (Fig. 1A) in an S. cerevisiae S288C-derived background, we first complemented a genomic elp3 deletion with the wild type ELP3 gene on a centromeric URA3 plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Next, URM1 was deleted and the resulting strain (elp3 urm1 [ELP3-URA3]) grown along with its parent (elp3 [ELP3-URA3]) on SC-URA and on FOA+URA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Both strains grow equally well on SC-URA, a medium used to maintain the ELP3 wild type allele but show very distinct growth phenotypes on FOA+URA, a medium on which the ELP3 carrying plasmid cannot be propagated due to counter-selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, growth of the elp3urm1 double mutant is severely delayed, but loss of the ELP3 carrying plasmid is tolerated (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Using this strategy, we also obtained a viable elp3uba4 double mutant, indicating the complete absence of mcm5s2 can be tolerated and may not necessarily cause synthetic lethality in S. cerevisiae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This is in stark contrast to a previous report [17] on the inviability of another yeast strain (W303 background) lacking mcm5s2U. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>It should be noted, that the W303 genome differs detectably from the S288C reference genome [29], hence differential sensitivities to the entire removal of wobble uridine modifications are not entirely unexpected. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous reports, elp3 mutants are defective in the formation of mcm5U, mcm5s2U and ncm5U but accumulate s2U, which is not detected in the wild type (Fig. 1C), thus reconfirming the notion that U34 thiolation can occur in the absence of mcm5 formation (Fig. 1A; [2]). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We first checked morphology of the elp3uba4 double mutant in comparison to the wild type (S1 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We found a small number of irregularly shaped cells containing elongated and/or multiple buds which were not observed for the isogenic wild type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>There were no other significant differences between wild type and the elp3uba4 double mutant with respect to cell size or nuclear morphology (S1 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>As an initial test to the functional role of mcm5s2U, we asked whether the complete absence of the modification might affect the ability of tRNAGln UUG, to recognize non-cognate codons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>It was shown previously that mcm5s2U modified tRNAGln UUG is able to decode the alternative CAG codon via U/G wobbling when present at elevated levels but not under normal circumstances [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Thus, high copy tRNAGln UUG suppresses the lethal effect of a deletion in SUP70, the only gene for tRNAGln CUG [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Since tRNALeu UAG, the only known yeast tRNA naturally carrying an unmodified wobble uridine is capable of efficient decoding of all four CUN codons by wobble base pairing [2, 31], it appeared possible that complete absence of wobble uridine modifications might also increase the ability of tRNAGln UUG to decode the CAG codon via U/G wobbling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To test this idea, we introduced a URA3 plasmid carrying the tRNAGln CUG gene into WT and elp3uba4 double mutants and subsequently deleted the single chromosomal gene for tRNAGln CUG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>On FOA medium, the URA3 plasmid-bourne tRNAGln CUG cannot be maintained, resulting in complete growth arrest of WT cells due to the inability of tRNAGln UUG to efficiently decode the CAG codon [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Growth assays further revealed that the elp3uba4 double deletion did not suppress the inviability on FOA medium (Fig. 2), indicating that tRNAGln UUG carrying an unmodified wobble uridine is also inable to efficiently decode the CAG codon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Hence, mcm5s2U is not responsible for the general inability of tRNAGln UUG to efficiently read the alternative G-ending codon. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We used elp3 and uba4 single and double mutants as well as trm9 mutants carrying ncm5/ncm5s2U instead of mcm5/mcm5s2U [16]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>While there were smaller effects in the trm9, uba4 and elp3 single mutants, total cellular protein content was markedly decreased in the elp3uba4 double mutant (Fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We also monitored differences in protein content for Cdc19 (pyruvate kinase; [32]) and Pfk1 (phosphofructokinase; [33]) and found that in general, differences in abundance are comparable to the effects on total protein levels (Fig. 3C, 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Both proteins are already reduced in abundance in the elp3 single mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In the complete absence of mcm5s2 (elp3uba4), however, Cdc19 is hardly detectable, while Pfk1 becomes entirely undetectable, indicating a significant negative impact of the tRNA modification defect on the abundance of these two proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In comparison to elp3 and elp3uba4 strains, trm9 and uba4 single mutants less severely decreased the abundance of Pfk1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>For Cdc19, levels were slightly decreased in trm9 but not in uba4 backgrounds (Fig. 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To verify equal cell numbers, portions of adjusted cell suspensions were removed before initializing chemical lysis, serially diluted and spotted on YPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 3C and 3D, all tRNA modification mutants, including the elp3uba4 mutant, where Pfk1 and Cdc19 signals are severely reduced, formed comparable numbers of viable cells in individual spots, indicating a similar input to chemical lysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Since the drop dilution method might not be suitable to detect smaller changes in viable cell titers, we grew wild type cells along with the elp3uba4 double mutant to early exponential phase (OD600nm ∼0.5), adjusted both cultures to OD600nm = 1 and determined exact total and viable cell titers by hemocytometry and viability plating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Indeed, there is a slight deviation (−13.9% for elp3uba4 compared to WT) in total cell numbers which is likely attributable to above mentioned changes in morphology that affect OD600nm/total cell number ratios (S2 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that elp3uba4 double mutants exhibit an even greater loss of viable cell counts (−22.6% compared to WT), indicating a significant accumulation of dead cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this latter notion by staining dead cells with methylene blue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>While these are essentially absent in the exponential WT culture, dead cells are detectable for the elp3uba4 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed a number of spontaneously lysed cells, which stain dark in phase contrast and weakly positive with methylene blue. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Of the affected tRNA species, 3 are normally destined to carry mcm5s2U34, which is generated by the joint action of the Elongator-controlled pathway and the Elongator independent tRNA thiolation pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Elongator and tRNA thiolation mutants display overlapping phenotypes, including TS and hypersensitivity to the TOR inhibitor rapamycin [19, 22, 24, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The suppressor effect of elevated levels of tRNALys UUU on the TS phenotype of elp3 suggested malfunction of this tRNA to be mainly responsible for the growth defect and indicates that such malfunction can be compensated for by excess of the hypomodifed tRNA [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>It was shown that loss of wobble uridine modifications does not affect abundance or aminoacylation of any of the 11 tRNA species targeted by Elongator- and/or thiolation pathways, indicating hypomodification-induced decoding rather than charging defects [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis further suggested that mcm5s2U primarily enhances decoding efficiency of the cognate, A-ending codons since under normal circumstances, there is no wobble decoding of the alternative G-ending codon by tRNAGlnmcm5s2 UUG or tRNAGlumcm5s2 UUC [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The finding that combined loss of wobble uridine mcm5/ncm5 modification and thiolation has lethal effects in the S. cerevisiae W303-1B background, which can also be suppressed by excess of tRNALys UUU suggested that mcm5 and s2 wobble uridine side chains are most critical for the function of this tRNA in decoding [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, combined loss of wobble uridine mcm5 modification and thiolation is tolerated in Caenorhabditis elegans grown at 15°C [34] and also in fission yeast, an elp3ctu1 (ortholog of ncs6) double deletion is viable [35], arguing against an absolute requirement of mcm5s2U for life in eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>To reinvestigate this issue, we used a plasmid shuffle approach and analyzed synthetic interactions between Elongator and tRNA thiolation mutants in a non-W303 background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We show that in the S288C-derived reference strain BY4741, both modification pathways can be simultaneously inactivated at the expense of a synthetic growth defect and a TS-phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The difference between the S288C- and W303-derived strains in tolerance to the complete removal of mcm5s2U could be linked to any of the 799 proteins predicted to exhibit sequence alterations in a W303 derived strain [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous loss of both pathways in the BY4741 strain did not increase the ability of tRNAGln UUG to recognize the alternative G-ending (CAG) codon, suggesting that the mcm5s2 modification is not responsible for the inability of mcm5s2U carrying tRNAs to wobble decode G-ending codons, but may rather function to improve recognition of the cognate A-ending codon, as suggested previously [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>While this work was in progress, another study reported the construction of viable elp3uba4 double mutants in the prototrophic S. cerevisiae CEN.PK background, which resulted in the inactivation of metabolic cycling, a phenomenon that was not observed for either single mutant [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The existence of yet another non-W303 strain tolerating the entire removal of mcm5s2U [36] suggests that the lethal effects observed in the W303 strain [17] may represent an exception rather than the rule. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>We also found additive or synergistic effects with respect to rapamycin-, caffeine-, SDS- and NaCl-sensitivity when combining elp3 and uba4 mutations (Figs. 4 and S5), suggesting the majority of single mutant phenotypes arise from a translational defect that becomes aggravated in the combined absence of mcm5 and s2 modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We checked the effects of mcm5s2U removal on total cellular protein levels in S. cerevisiae and observed a severe depletion of cellular protein content that was also exemplified for Cdc19 and Pfk1, usually two highly abundant proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR assays excluded the possibility of a drastic transcriptional defect for CDC19, PFK1 or ACT1 genes in the elp3uba4 double mutant, indicating the observed effects result from a disturbance of post-transcriptional events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, many highly abundant proteins related to sugar- and carbohydrate metabolism, such as Tdh1, Tdh2, Adh1, Tpi1, Pgk1 and also Cdc19 were found in a genome wide SILAC approach to be significantly undertranslated in S. cerevisiae cells lacking uba4 or ncs2 [36, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>While we did not observe strong effects on total protein levels or Cdc19/Pfk1 in uba4 alone, these data clearly support our conclusion that total protein levels are regulated by wobble uridine mcm5s2U modification, since partial removal (e.g. exchange of mcm5s2U to mcm5U) can already diminish highly abundant proteins [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our data may suggest that this effect could be exacerbated upon complete removal of mcm5s2U. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The removal of mcm5s2U could affect the efficiency of translational elongation directly, as both side chains (s2 and mcm5) were already shown to enhance the binding of tRNALys UUU to the ribosomal A-site in vitro [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, since SILAC experiments also revealed a clear induction of proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and protein folding/stability in elp3/urm1 single mutants [27], increased protein degradation or decreased protein stability may also contribute to overall lowered protein detection in mcm5s2U lacking strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the interpretation that loss of wobble uridine modifications can cause protein stress, it was shown previously that trm9 mutants lacking the methytransferase involved in mcm5 side chain formation activate certain heat shock proteins and markers of the unfolded protein response [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Additionally, elp2, uba4, ncs2 and ncs6 mutants were shown to accumulate ubiquitinated proteins and urm1 as well as trm9 mutants upregulate heat shock/protein stress transcripts UBI4 and SSA4, possibly indicating protein stress in the absence of mcm5 or s2 uridine modification [38, 39, 40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Also, the fact that the elp3uba4 double mutant accumulates dead cells during exponential growth phase needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting results of reduced protein levels, in particular since a fraction of cells of this strain appears to undergo spontaneous cell lysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Thus, effects of complete mcm5s2 removal on cellular protein levels are likely both, direct (affecting the translational elongation step) and indirect (inducing cell death and protein stress). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a key role of mcm5s2U in tRNALys UUU for the maintenance of translational capacity, cellular protein levels were partially restored in the elp3uba4 double mutant by overexpression of this tRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Thus, the severely reduced translational efficiency of tRNALys UUU lacking mcm5s2 can be compensated by increasing its abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The easiest interpretation for this property is that absence of wobble uridine modification induces a binding defect of tRNALys UUU to the ribosomal A-site (for which there is in vitro evidence [27]) and increasing the abundance of the affected tRNA can compensate for this defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>A related example, where overexpression of a weak decoder can improve its in vivo function is tRNAGln UUG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, this tRNA is an inefficient CAG decoder due to the U/G wobble base pair in CAG:UUG codon anticodon interaction [3] and in complete absence of tRNAGln CUG, cells die due to this decoding inefficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Upon overexpression of tRNAGln UUG, however, cells can tolerate the absence of tRNAGln CUG [3], indicating that elevated levels of the inefficient CAG decoder can compensate this defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The finding that single overexpression of tRNALys UUU but not tRNAGln UUG or tRNAGlu UUC can detectably suppress growth defects of elp3uba4 mutants (Figs. 4B and S3) indicates that upon removal of mcm5s2U, tRNALys UUU is the most affected one among the three tRNAs carrying this modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, since growth defects are most efficiently rescued by combined overexpression of all three tRNAs normally carrying mcm5s2 (Fig. 4B), it is also evident that all of them are affected to some extent by loss of the modification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Since there is a close correlation between the severity of growth phenotypes and cellular protein content and both, growth defects and diminished protein levels can be rescued by elevated copy numbers of tRNALys UUU, we conclude that the reduced protein levels in absence of mcm5s2U are the cause of the observed growth phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A recent study in S. cerevisiae determined that individual loss of wobble uridine mcm5/ncm5 modification or thiolation affects translational efficiency depending on transcript codon usage, where translation of transcripts enriched for AAA-, CAA-, and GAA-codons was specifically affected [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Another genome wide study indicated these effects on AAA, CAA and GAA decoding would be too small to affect protein output [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Our findings of reduced protein levels in elp3uba4 cells and the suppression of this effect by excess of tRNALys UUU may support a role of AAA codon usage in regulating the translational capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>However, a severe malfunction of any tRNA that cannot be replaced by an alternative isodecoder would result in a global, rather than codon-specific translational defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The strong growth and protein defects in the elp3uba4 double mutant and their suppression by tRNALys UUU indicate that in the absence of mcm5s2U, this tRNA becomes defective enough to affect protein levels in a manner largely independent of AAA codon frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>We conclude that individual loss of mcm5 and s2 modifications in tRNA cause rather subtle translational defects that may affect the proteome differentially based on codon frequency, whereas the complete loss of mcm5s2 results in a more global defect in protein homeostasis that may be caused by defective translational elongation and/or the induction of cellular stress pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In support of the latter option, individual loss of mcm5 or s2 wobble uridine modifications was shown to activate the general aminoacid control pathway, a consequence of which is the inhibition of global translation, and interfere with TOR pathway signaling [28, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Since tRNA thiolation and mcm5 side chain formation are independent pathways and were shown to respond to different environmental or endogenous stimuli such as sulfur availability, cell cycle progression and temperature stress [36, 40, 42, 43, 44], future work will need to decipher how cross talk between both pathways manages to produce different outputs on translational efficiency, ranging from moderate, codon specific to more drastic global effects. </plain></SENT>
