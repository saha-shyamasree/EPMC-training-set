</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mortality data are essential for defining and evaluating public health policies and for inferring about the health status of the population in a country [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, medical certification of cause of death is used in only one third of deaths occurring worldwide and a lack of accurate death registration systems is common in most developing countries, particularly where mortality is highest [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As in other Sub-Sahara African countries, in Angola the causes of death and their determinants are not well documented [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In recent years, Angola faced great social and economic changes, resulting from the end of an armed conflict of almost 30 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in less than a decade, a vibrant economy has transformed the country from a low income centrally-planned system to a middle income market economy [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Such development brings changes in the societal and economic structure which, in turn, impacts health and mortality patterns [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the resources needed to implement an accurate and complete vital statistics system are not yet fulfilled. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Even though World Health Organization (WHO) provides estimates of deaths by cause for the country (the main causes in 2012 were respiratory infections, diarrhea, neonatal deaths, cardiovascular diseases and malaria [11]), these figures pertain to aggregated data, not describing regional patterns (for example, cause-specific mortality in identified malaria endemic areas). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In Angola, death certification is only done routinely for violent deaths and on those occurring in hospitals or in other health facilities [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, it is estimated that only about 5 % of under-five children deaths take place at the hospitals [13] and that about 45 % of the population has access to any type of health care [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The system thus fails to collect data on deaths occurring at home or at small health units and is therefore insufficient to reliably inform about mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In countries with limited or non-existent death registration systems, the use of verbal autopsy (VA) is recommended to ascertain probable causes of death [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Verbal autopsy as a method to estimate cause-specific mortality, but also to study risk factors for specific diseases and the effects of public health interventions, is increasing in the developing world and is now used in more than 115 countries [1, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Verbal autopsy systems are often developed as part of population monitoring platforms, namely Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS), to allow longitudinal assessment of mortality trends and exploration of associated factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The Dande HDSS (Bengo, northern Angola), where a VA system is implemented since 2010, provides such an opportunity [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This study aims to describe the main causes of deaths and explore factors associated with broad mortality groups for the period 2009–2012 in the Dande HDSS study area. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The Dande HDSS is located in Dande municipality, Bengo province, about 60 km northeast of Luanda, in Northen Angola. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>It was established and is managed by CISA—Health Research Centre in Angola—to overcome the scarcity of complete vital records, the lack of knowledge on demographic characteristics and living conditions of the population in this region and to create a sampling frame for epidemiological studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Detailed information about the HDSS scope, design and implementation, methodology and data management procedures is published elsewhere [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The Dande HDSS covers all 71 hamlets of Caxito, Mabubas and Úcua, 3 of the 6 communes composing the Dande municipality, with a contiguous total area of 4763.6 km2 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Map of the study area—Angola, Bengo Province, Dande Municipality </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Thirty hamlets are considered urban (agglomerations of 2000 or more inhabitants and basic infrastructures) and 41 are rural, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Angola (INEA) definitions [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In the initial census, performed in 2009, a population of 59,683 individuals living in 15,643 households was registered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In December 2012, the population covered by the HDSS was of 60,614 residents. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The Angolan Health System encompasses public and private sector providers, the former being the main provider. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The national public health system is hierarchically organized in primary health care centers (these include small health care units, nursing centres and municipal hospitals), secondary level general hospitals and tertiary level reference hospitals [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The Dande Municipality, where the study area is located, is served by eleven primary health care facilities, one health centre, one maternal and infant centre, one municipal hospital and one general hospital [17]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>After the initial census, that was performed between August 2009 and March 2010, 18 fieldworkers periodically visited all the households of the study area to record basic demographic events, including reported deaths (quarterly update rounds took place until the end of 2011 and, due to logistic and administrative issues, a single 6-month round was performed in 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This study covers the deaths which occurred from August 2009 to December 2012. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>After a mourning period of approximately a month and a half, three fieldworkers specifically trained to apply the VA tool, individually visited the households of the deceased and interviewed the caregiver of the deceased or other close relative. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Three versions of the standard INDEPTH/WHO model of the VA questionnaire [18, 19] were used (one for neonatal deaths—0 to 27 days, one for children—28 days to 14 years, and one for adults—15 years or more) adapted to include the main pathologies known in the region and local terminologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The VA questionnaires are structured into different sections, and include open questions on the circumstances of the death, sociodemographic data of the interviewee and of the deceased, a checklist of signs and symptoms experienced before death (including their duration), accidents, accessibility to health care, place of death and any available health records, namely vaccination register, laboratory exams results and death certificate. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the probable cause of death, each questionnaire was interpreted independently by two physicians with local experience and trained on reviewing the VA questionnaires and assigning the cause of death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Training of physicians in the interpretation of the questionnaires was based on case definition using clinical diagnostic algorithms adapted from other VA systems [18, 20–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In case of discordance between the two physicians, the questionnaire was reviewed by a third physician and the majority rule was applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, if the third physician determined a different cause of death, the case was registered as indeterminate [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The reading physicians were staff of the General Provincial Hospital, partner of the Health Research Centre of Angola and also the setting where the Centre is located. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This clinical staff is mostly composed of Angolan national practitioners, although there are also foreign doctors (Cuban) working in this context for several years, as part of bilateral cooperation agreements between governments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>For each VA questionnaire reading, the Centre paid a symbolic fee to the physicians, in order to compensate their participation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The Hospital benefits of the results of the verbal autopsy system, an important tool to the knowledge of the main causes of death in the study area. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The international form for medical certificate of cause of death was used, which is divided in two parts: the first describes the sequence of morbid conditions directly leading to death; the second describes other diseases or conditions which may have contributed to the death, but which were not involved in the fatal sequence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Though the international death certificate typically uses the underlying cause of death, ascertaining a single cause of death from various possible causes identifiable from the reported symptoms may be inappropriate using VA data [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Mortality is often due to the effects of multiple conditions, and particularly in the case of infant death, it is more difficult to distinguish, in terms of semiology and differential diagnosis, the main causes that lead to death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Additionally, concerning adults is quite straightforward the distinction between comorbidities and underlying cause for death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>For those reasons, multiple causes of death were considered for children under 15 years old and the underlying cause of death was considered for adults. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Causes of death were coded using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) [26]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>After classification based on ICD-10, specific causes of death were categorized according to the three mortality groups of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) structure [27] and a fourth for indeterminate causes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Group I included deaths attributed to communicable diseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (CD): intestinal infectious diseases, tuberculosis (TB), other bacterial diseases, rabies, measles, viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, nutritional deficiencies, meningitis, otitis, conditions related to or aggravated by the pregnancy, childbirth or by the puerperium (maternal causes or obstetric causes) and certain conditions originating in the perinatal period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Group II consisted of non-communicable diseases (NCD): malignant neoplasms, respiratory disorders, mental and behavioral disorders, epilepsy, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the digestive system, diseases of the genitourinary system, skin disorders and congenital abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Group III comprised of injuries (INJ): injury, poisoning and other consequences of external causes of morbidity and mortality, such as burns and corrosions, toxic effects of substances chiefly nonmedicinal as to source, complications of surgical and medical care, traffic accidents, intentional self-harm, assault, event of undetermined intent, accidental drowning and submersion, struck by thrown, projected or falling object, falls, contact with scorpions, exposure to unspecific electric current and handgun discharge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Indeterminate causes (IND) included: unknown and unspecified causes of mortality (physicians assigned the VA as ill-defined or as unknown cause of mortality—codes R95-R99 of ICD-10) and those cases that the VA method didn’t reach a consensus on the cause of death. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of deaths occurring in children under five (33.9 % of all deaths occur in this age group) is characteristic of a developing country [4, 29, 30] and is consistent with the WHO latest mortality data estimates for Angola [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The 2012 WHO estimates for the distribution of causes of death in children under 5, place respiratory diseases (17.1 %), diarrhea (14.6 %) and malaria (12.6 %) as the main causes of death, which is similar to our findings, although with a higher burden for deaths caused by malaria (28.2 %), diarrhea (23.0 %) and a lower frequency of respiratory diseases as causes of death (11.9 %). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Being the Dande HDSS study area a malaria endemic region [31, 32], there might be a tendency to over diagnose malaria and misclassify other fever deaths [33–35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Over diagnosis of a particular cause of death, known as endemic in a particular region, has been pointed as one of the limitations of the VA methodology, reducing its performance [1, 4, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>One other factor that may have contributed to an overestimation of malaria and intestinal infections as causes of death, was the methodology we opted for assigning multiple causes for neonatal and children deaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Multiple effects and several medical conditions influence mortality, particularly in children and the elderly [36], and in contexts like Dande, the selection of the underlying cause of death is often arbitrary [4, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>One of the arguments commonly used in favor of the methodology which involves assigning multiple causes of death is related with the lack of criteria to select a single cause of death to the detriment of others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>If the VA system aims to understand epidemiological needs at a population level, rather than describe the causes of deaths at individual level, selecting a single cause may be less appropriate than assigning multiple causes, particularly for the purposes of public-health support [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of death among all adults aged 15–49 years old were TB and traffic accidents, although for women, pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium complications were responsible for the highest proportion of deaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The National Plan for Development of Health identifies TB and traffic accidents as enormous problems for the population aged 15–45 years old [14], although accurate statistics are not provided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The Global Health Estimates [11], point to a lower proportion of TB and a higher burden of HIV deaths in this age group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>As reported in other studies [4, 29], VA might have contributed to an underestimation of HIV-related deaths, since the co-morbidity of TB and HIV [38, 39] might have influenced the weight of both diagnoses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Traffic accidents were recently pointed as the second major cause of death in the country by the government in the media [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The increased availability of motor vehicles and the improvement in life conditions is likely to raise the burden of traffic INJ in this age group [41], which adds to the poor road infrastructures and drinking and driving culture. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Regarding deaths among women of reproductive age, our results confirm the need to prioritize interventions to improve reproductive and maternal health, since maternal-related deaths rates in Angola are amongst the highest in the world [42], and the reduction of its burden is a specific goal envisaged in the Millennium Development Goals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Among the eldest groups (50 or more years of age), circulatory system diseases were the leading causes of death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Such finding is consistent with the results from other studies showing that deaths related to the circulatory system, particularly cardiovascular diseases, increases with age [5, 29, 33, 43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In 2010, our group conducted a community-based survey of 1464 adults residing in the Dande municipality, and found a 23 % prevalence of hypertension [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an expected increase in the burden attributable to chronic diseases among adults, resultant from the country’s fast economic growth and lifestyles changes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results show similar distributions of deaths by broad GBD groups compared to those found in Tanzania [33], particularly in what concerns NCD (12 % in our study vs. 15 % in Tanzania) and INJ (9 % in both studies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The higher estimate of CD found in our study (61 %) might be explained by the inclusion of children (the Tanzania study, focused on adult deaths, and found 41 % of CD deaths) and is more close to the findings of a study among adolescents and adults conducted in rural western Kenya, which found 74 % of deaths caused by CD [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Mortality in these regions is still largely marked by infectious diseases, despite the increasing deaths caused by NCD and INJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, which a majority of developing countries in Africa is facing, has been called the “triple burden” [29, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Some of the factors usually linked to the increasing prevalence of NCD and INJ in developing countries are related with socioeconomic conditions improvement which impacts lifestyles changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Therefore we explored the associations of socioeconomic conditions in broad mortality groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>For this, we used essentially two SEP proxy measures: the educational level and the quintiles of an index summarizing household conditions, which has been extensively used in other HDSSs to study inequalities in several health outcomes [8, 25, 29, 33, 46–48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were observed according to the quintiles of the SEP index created, although point estimates suggest positive associations in those groups who might be considered socially disadvantaged, compared to those less disadvantaged, for CD and NCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The gradient observed in CD deaths according to the educational level, is in line with the results of a recent study conducted in Chakaria, Bangladesh, where mortality due to CD was more frequent among the poorest [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In the same study, NCD as leading causes of death also concentrated among the population from the higher SEP groups [47], contrasting our results for adult NCD deaths according to the educational level as shown in Fig. 2f. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that the expected epidemiological transition in the leading causes of death is only in its early stage [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we would expect a steeper socioeconomic gradient for all main causes of death, given the fast development observed in the country in the last decade [6] and the known inequalities in mortality observed worldwide and in the country [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to explore other SEP measures, such as the subjective social status [51], potentially more useful to disentangle underlying inequalities of health in this context. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Most deaths studied occurred in the urban area, following the population distribution in the study area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The higher likelihood of an INJ death in residents from rural compared to urban hamlets was a rather surprising finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, we should notice that only the deceased residence is known, and death might have happened in an urban area (outside a health facility). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>When isolating the specific causes of death by injuries, we can observe the weight of those related with traffic accidents and accidental drowning and submersion, both in rural and urban areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In rural areas the villages are situated along the road and those have relatively poor conditions and some traffic, especially of trucks transporting raw materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This has been the cause of road and pedestrian accidents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Likewise, people living in rural areas have to travel long distances which may explain the higher likelihood to die of INJ, particularly of transport accidents. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>To better understand the context of INJ deaths, we recently included a specific module in our VA questionnaire, which will be the focus of future exploration (as the characterization and context of the main deaths caused by INJ in order to sustain public health interventions and specific campaigns). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Regarding place of death, CD and NCD deaths happened more commonly in a health facility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, more than 40 % of CD and NCD deaths were registered outside a health facility, which emphasizes the usefulness of the VA system in the region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The identification of causes of deaths through VA methodology in the scope of a continuous surveillance system is the strength of this study considering the lack of information in this context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>In Angola where data on mortality is based on hospital and government reports, only the number of people dying under medical care is accounted for and death certificates lack accuracy [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>However it is of crucial importance to know the causes associated to all deaths [52, 53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Bengo Province, where the study area is located, is reported as an endemic region for several infectious diseases responsible for morbidity and mortality in Angola [14, 31], however there is a very limited capacity of the health structures of registering and measuring the impact of that endemicity on mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The estimated crude mortality for the 3 years encompassing the study period, suggests a decrease in rates, which is in line with the WHO estimates for the same period [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>However, the estimated crude mortality rate for 2012 that we observed (6.6 per 1000, 95 % CI: 5.9–7.2) may be underestimated: during this period, only one update HDSS round was performed, as opposed to the usual biannual rounds, thus fewer events were reported explaining the observed decrease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In our study, 18.3 % of deaths were IND, 8.7 % for child and 27.5 % for all adult deaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>This figure lies between the results found in other sub-saharan African countries, namely in Ethiopia (reporting VA deaths for the period 2009–2013) [5] where 14.9 % of deaths were IND and a 2012 study from Tanzania reporting 31 % deaths with indeterminate causes [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of IND causes of death is a common limitation attributed to the VA system, that may result from the relatively low specificity and sensitivity of the VA tool for detecting some causes of death [4, 29], and from other influencing factors such as the interaction between interviewer and respondent, the setting where the VA is performed, recall bias and the subjectivity inherent to the physician review [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of what determines indeterminate causes is warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>One other problem felt in the Dande HDSS, is the scarcity of physicians available to be trained to read VA questionnaires. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In the future, the validity of the causes of death derived from VA reviewed by physicians should be tested with the use of a probabilistic approach, such as the InterVA method [1]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study confirm international estimates on the main causes of death and provide a more detailed picture of mortality in this region, informing health policies and focused interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The VA system proves to be a useful tool in this context, where almost half of deaths occur outside a health facility and mortality data is scarce and often inaccurate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Preventive measures should be given priority, since infectious diseases remain the major cause of death, despite the country’s development in the past decade. </plain></SENT>
