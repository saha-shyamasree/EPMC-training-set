</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to explore pedometer-determined diurnal profiles of physical activity in chronically ill and mobility-limited older adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prolonging periods of elevated physical activity in the afternoon while respecting individual daily routine and commitments could be one option for facilitating the integration of physical activity and for making it a habit in older adults’ daily lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of a walking aid seems to be an indicator for a quite low activity plateau during the second half of the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>People who use walking aids should be motivated to increase their physical activity during afternoon; this might help to increase the overall low physical activity level of this vulnerable subgroup of older adults. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity has the potential to preserve or even improve health and health-related quality of life up until old age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have proven this impressively, even in chronically ill, functionally impaired, or very old adults[1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, for the most part, the activity behavior of the older population does not conform to current recommendations [2–5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, physical activity levels are even lower among persons affected by chronic diseases or functional limitations [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In order to derive reasonable health promotion and intervention strategies, it is important to better understand the physical activity behavior of older adults, and particularly those being chronically ill and functionally impaired. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A wide range of epidemiological studies have examined physical activity in older adults [4, 8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>So far, studies either focused on total activity over a certain period of time, e.g., per week or per day, usually in order to evaluate older adults’ physical activity level with respect to current guidelines, or on correlates of overall physical activity [11, 12], or on motivators and barriers [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Without any doubt, these studies provide fundamental information [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>There is, however, scant knowledge about the timing of physical activity during the course of a day. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>One of the few studies to report on daily physical activity profiles was a one-case study that explored the physical activity behavior of an older woman living alone [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This study assessed physical activity by means of a complex monitoring system installed on a computer in a private household. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Since the hourly activity recording was limited to physical activities at home, and due to the one-case study character, it is nearly impossible to generalize the results with regard to older adults’ physical activity behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Another study investigated diurnal profiles of physical activity by accelerometer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of all ages [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To the authors’ knowledge, no studies have been published to date that evaluate diurnal profiles of physical activity with a focus on community-dwelling older adults with chronic diseases and functional limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An explorative analysis of physical activity in the course of the day may provide new and interesting insights regarding the physical activity behavior of those older adults, and might help to generate hypotheses on optimized physical activity promotion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Physical activity behavior is considered to be influenced by a complex interaction of sociodemographic, physical, psychological, social, environmental and sociopolitical factors [12, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Sex and age are two of the most consistent factors influencing physical activity [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Physical health status and functional limitations have also been shown to be highly important determinants of physical activity behavior in older adults [7, 12, 13, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is increasing evidence that physical activity behavior is subject to seasonal variations [7, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Day length, maximum temperature and sunshine duration were shown to be associated with physical activity levels [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that sex, age, morbidity, mobility limitation, and season might not only influence overall physical activity, but may also differently impact older adults’ physical activity in the course of the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To date, no data has been reported on this topic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the aim of the present study was to analyze diurnal profiles of physical activity for community-dwelling, chronically ill and mobility-limited adults aged 70 years and over, and to explore the moderating effect of sex, age, morbidity, mobility limitation, and season on physical activity in the course of the day. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The following criteria were defined in order to obtain valid and reliable data on usual daily physical activity: 1) the participants had to wear the pedometer all day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>2) They had to reach a minimum of 300 steps per day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Days with less than 300 steps were deleted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Each day with a minimum of 300 steps was considered for analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>3) Finally, participants had to wear the pedometer on at least 2 days between Monday and Saturday (M-S days) and on a Sunday. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Past studies have reported that 3 days are adequate for measurement of older adults’ usual physical activity by pedometer, due to low day-to-day variability of physical activity in this age group [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>However, older adults’ physical activity level has been shown to be lower on Sundays than on the other days of the week [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Our study therefore aimed to obtain physical activity data from at least 3 days, including a Sunday. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>No plausible suggestions were available in the literature for a lower cut-off for older adults’ daily activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In a review on expected values for pedometer-determined physical activity in older populations Tudor-Locke et al. pointed out: “[…] Data for any single day indicating &lt; 1,000 steps were removed […]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>No other study described any other treatment for […] extreme values” [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>A lower cut off point of 1000 steps, however, seemed too high and thus inappropriate for a chronically ill and mobility-limited population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Another review on expected step counts for older adults and special populations presented the step cadence of patients with peripheral arterial disease [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>During a 30-minute walk under free-living conditions, they accumulated 35 steps/min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This would results in 300 steps after only 8.5 minutes of walking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The stride length of a sample of older adults recruited from nursing facilities in Germany was 41.1 ± 10.7 cm (own data, unpublished yet). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>300 steps would correspond to approximately only 120 m walking distance on a whole day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Against this background, 300 steps were assumed to be a plausible minimum amount for a whole day measurement of physical activity in this specific study population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Due to a varying number of M-S days with step data per participant (minimum 2, maximum 5 M-S days), physical activity per day was calculated as weighted mean for each participant ([6 × average of M-S steps + Sunday steps]/7) in order to obtain a value for physical activity per day representing his/her total week. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Hourly pedometer output was analyzed the same for each participant, e.g., [6 × average of M-S steps between 6 am and 7 am + Sunday steps between 6 am and 7 am]/7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Pedometer wear time was counted in full hours beginning with the first steps in the morning until the last steps in the evening. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the overall diurnal profile of physical activity revealed two peaks, with one peak in the late morning, a second peak in the afternoon, and a low point in between. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The low level of physical activity in the early afternoon could be explained by an afternoon nap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Studies showed that older people usually take a nap after lunch or in the early afternoon [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>One study elicited data on the sleeping habits of 1497 adults aged 55–85 years and over by telephone interview [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The results revealed the frequency of individuals taking afternoon naps increased with age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>For 25% of the 288 participants aged 75–85 years, an afternoon nap was an integral part of their daily routine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Chronically ill and mobility-limited older people were shown to have even higher volumes of afternoon naps [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>With respect to afternoon napping habits between men and women, a study with 10126 participants revealed that men took afternoon naps more often and longer than women [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This finding might explain men’s lower physical activity level in general and during the early afternoon compared to women in the present study, though sex-related differences were not significant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Older adults who regularly engaged in exercise or leisure time physical activities of at least moderate intensity were excluded during recruitment for the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>It may therefore be assumed that phases of higher activity throughout the day were mostly due to basic (e.g. bathing, dressing, eating) and instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. housework, shopping), or social activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Such activities constitute an integral part of the daily routine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Studies showed that daily routines may improve health and well-being [32, 33], and are strongly associated with sleep quality in older adults [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the regular integration of exercise or leisure time activity on a daily basis, i.e., the establishment of an “exercise routine”, would also contribute to enhanced sleep quality, health and health-related quality of life in older adults with sedentary or low activity levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In order to create routines, it would seem to be necessary to identify spare time for leisure time physical activity or exercise that does not compete with existing important routines and commitments in the course of the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed a slight peak between 3 and 4 pm, and a sharp decrease in physical activity from 4 pm on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>One option might be prolonging this relatively short phase of higher physical activity in the afternoon by implementing physical activity programs during this time of the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Since the explorative analysis of diurnal physical activity behavior revealed relatively high inter-individual variation (reflected by the wide confidence intervals [see Figures  2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7]), individualized approaches might be another, probably even more promising option to integrate an optimized physical activity or exercise routine into older adults’ lives. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>A mobility limitation was the only factor with both, a significant effect on overall physical activity levels and on diurnal activity profiles, irrespective of participants’ sex, age, and morbidity, and the season. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Gait unsteadiness due to a loss of lower-body strength and balance, and resulting fear may be an explanation for the overall decreased activity in older people who depend on a walking aid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Several studies showed that using walking devices is independently associated with being more fearful of falling [35, 36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Fear of falling has in turn been reported as a barrier to physical activity [13, 37, 38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In those with moderate or severe mobility limitation, fear of falling has been even more frequently reported as a barrier to exercise [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that fear-induced activity reduction [39] or the need for a walking aid [40], and the tendency to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle accelerate functional deconditioning and disability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The adjusted profile for older adults using a walking aid suggests that their lower overall physical activity may be partly attributable to the lack of a second activity peak in the afternoon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This activity plateau might be one starting point for increasing physical activity levels in older adults using walking aids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Balancing possibilities for accessing inactive older adults with functional limitations, Schofield et al. [41] report that the general practitioner (GP) is the most trusted source of physical activity information, especially for this target group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A GP is one of the few persons who has regular access to mobility-limited older adults and often has trusting long-lasting relationships with those patients [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The GP may play a central role in promoting physical activity to this hard-to-reach target group, namely hardly active or sedentary, chronically ill and mobility-limited older adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The GP could raise their awareness of the necessity of physical activity and opportunities to become more active, what could help them increase their physical activity and manage their health. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The present study targeted community-dwelling, though chronically ill and mobility-limited older adults with a low physical activity level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>They are difficult to reach for exercise interventions, as many of them rarely leave their homes [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The success of the approach to access and recruit this hard-to-reach target group for an exercise intervention via their GP was unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>A selection towards fitter and healthier older adults in intervention studies is a known research problem [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In our study, all older adults over the age of 70 years who visited their GP within the past 6 months, and fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria were given the chance to participate in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, a certain selection towards healthier and fitter older adults during the multi-stage recruitment for the trial, e.g. the phase of response to the invitations for final eligibility screening, cannot be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Additionally, participants dropped out from our study, if they did not fulfil certain analysis criteria (see methods section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The flow chart, however, indicated that sex and age did only marginally change from the 245 eligible participants to the 149 patients analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>We aimed to reach as high representativeness as possible regarding the recruitment of a sample of chronically ill and mobility-limited older adults with low physical activity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our results should be regarded as relevant for a population of older primary health care patients who fulfil eligibility criteria for the present study, and who would participate in an exercise intervention study in their GP’s practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed physical activity by means of the pedometer OMRON Walking Style Pro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Exact pedometer wear time was not documented by participants in order to not overstrain them with documentation demands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Instead of that, participant documented whether they wore the device for the whole day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The lack of a definite start and end point of physical activity lowers the validity of data on calculated average steps per hour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This is a limitation of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the specific pedometer model has already been demonstrated in young adults [45] and middle-aged adults [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Some studies, however, have reported reduced accuracy for slower walking [46–48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This could affect physical activity measurement in the present sample of mobility-limited older adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>We tried to maximize precision by using a piezoelectric pedometer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>These sensors were shown to be more accurate in slow walking speeds than spring-levered pedometers [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>They are thus more appropriate for use in elderly and special populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Additionally, participants were instructed to wear the device at the waistband/belt which was shown to be the most precise of the four proposed mounting positions [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Anyway, an underestimate of actual steps cannot be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, it may be assumed that while a measurement error of this nature would affect the absolute level of physical activity, it would not affect the distribution throughout the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>While the total physical activity levels reported in this study should therefore be interpreted with caution, the diurnal profiles of physical activity may be regarded as a true reflection of older adults’ daily physical activity rhythm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the objective pedometer-based physical activity measurement is an advantage of the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Pedometer measurement is not subject to recall or social-desirability bias [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Additionally, pedometers are considered to be very appropriate for use in older adults or patients because they are very easy to handle [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The lack of qualitative information on the content of physical activity throughout the day, however, is a limitation of the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Further studies on older adults’ diurnal physical activity profiles should include log entries, for instance, in order to better understand objectively measured physical activity behavior over the course of the day. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations, this is the first study to explore diurnal profiles of physical activity in community-dwelling, chronically ill and mobility-limited older people, which allows conclusions on optimized physical activity-promotion in this target group to be made. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The present findings allow suggestions to be made to optimize scheduling of leisure time physical activities and exercise in accordance with older adults’ daily rhythm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Prolonging periods of elevated physical activity in the afternoon while respecting individual daily routine and commitments could be an option for facilitating the integration of physical activity and for making it a habit in older adults’ daily lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The use of a walking aid seems to be an indicator for a quite low activity plateau during the second half of the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>People who use walking aids should be motivated to increase their physical activity during afternoon; this might help to increase the overall low physical activity level of this vulnerable subgroup of older adults. </plain></SENT>
