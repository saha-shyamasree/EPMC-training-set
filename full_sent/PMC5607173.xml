</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer in Western society, with a global incidence of over 380,000 [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Western populations 90% of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial origin (urothelial bladder cancer, UBC) and most patients (75–85%) present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC: stages Ta/T1/Tis) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with NMIBC are initially treated by transurethral tumour resection (TURBT), but recurrence is commonplace occurring in up to 80% of patients [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC: stages T2+) occurs in up to 45% of patients [4,5], and represents a critical step in the disease course, carrying a 5-year survival rate of only 27–50%, necessitating more radical therapies (including surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy) [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The most significant single risk factor for progression to MIBC is the presence of primary or concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This flat high-grade dysplasia is highly malignant with significant potential for invasion; patients diagnosed with CIS therefore undergo additional treatments following TURBT, principally repeated cycles of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy in a regimen of induction and maintenance [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite these efforts, 50% of patients relapse and are then at high risk of progression to MIBC, with poor prognosis [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There are currently no prognostic markers to identify those CIS patients who will respond to therapy and those who will relapse [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The tumour microenvironment is important in the initiation, growth and progression of cancer, and multiple interactions between tumour, stromal and immune cells have been described [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The contribution made by immune cells is complex—many different cell types have been identified within tumours, and the effects of a particular infiltrate can vary between different tumours [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>With regard to NMIBC, the potential role of the immune system is of particular interest since the most successful treatment currently utilised, BCG immunotherapy, is thought to act by inducing an acute inflammatory response in the bladder wall [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Studies thus far have examined macrophages [14], T cells [15,16] and the inflammatory response provoked by BCG [17], but many questions remain unanswered [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our objective was to comprehensively characterise the immune microenvironment of UBC, and its influence on outcomes, utilising tumour material prospectively collected from newly-diagnosed patients [18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Since we found that IL-17R was expressed by many bladder tumours, we decided to focus on the potential direct effects of IL-17 on bladder cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>IL-17 induced differential responses, demonstrated by the specific changes in phenotype and gene expression in different cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>IL-17 increased the growth rate of 5637 cells, concurring with previously published work examining the MB49 murine bladder cancer cell in mice [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-17 treatment of 5637 cells increased the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and decreased the expression of those involved in cell adhesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The former could potentially contribute to increased tumour growth in vivo, while the latter is consistent with CIS being a loosely-adherent lesion that often disseminates by the shedding and re-implantation of cells [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>In contrast, growth of the other two bladder cancer cell lines that we studied was not significantly affected by IL-17, despite eliciting a response by increased production of IL-6 and IL-8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis revealed that the 5637 and EJ cell lines had very different patterns of gene expression in response to IL-17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Taken together these results demonstrate that the direct effects of IL-17 vary markedly, even within the context of a single tumour type. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Although these in vitro effects were interesting, we sought to identify the consequences of IL-17+ MCs in patients by utilising the long-term outcome data linked to the tumour samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge that such an approach cannot directly address biological mechanisms of action, but we argue that it is more relevant to human health since it takes into account the clinical interventions that patients undergo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>As IL-17+ MCs were significantly associated with CIS, a lesion with a poor prognosis, we anticipated that increased numbers of these cells would be associated with poorer outcome, an association recently observed in gastric cancer [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, CIS patients with higher numbers of IL-17+ MCs had significantly longer event-free survival following intravesical BCG treatment than patients with a lower number of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>This finding is in-keeping with a recent study in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma where IL-17+ MCs were also identified, and increased numbers significantly associated with favourable survival [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In our study, we only observed a significant effect of IL-17+ MCs in patients who underwent intravesical BCG treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The significant effect that we observed in CIS is seemingly larger than the survival advantage seen in oesophageal cancer [44]; one possibility, therefore, is that BCG amplifies the beneficial effects associated with increased numbers of IL-17+ MCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Currently, we can only speculate as to why some cases of bladder CIS demonstrate increased numbers of IL-17+ MCs and others do not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>One possibility may be differences in the tumour microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>MCs enter tissues in an immature form, maturing in response to local stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Reports have demonstrated IL-17+ MCs at sites of active inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [45–47], psoriasis [48] and atherosclerotic plaques [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inflammatory mediators have been shown to stimulate IL-17 production from purified human MCs in vitro [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Thus, the microenvironment of CIS may stimulate MCs to produce IL-17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>We note that CIS biopsies contain both IL-17+ and IL-17- MCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The latter may reflect recent immigrants that have not yet developed an IL-17-producing phenotype, or a distinct subtype of MCs unresponsive to the environmental cues that stimulate production of IL-17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In this regard, mature connective tissue MCs, but not immature bone-marrow-derived MCs, have been shown to produce IL-17 following toll-like receptor-2 ligation [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the improved clinical outcomes associated with IL-17+ MCs and BCG is hampered by a lack of a suitable CIS mouse model [51,52], and fundamental differences between mouse and human MC biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Many reports show IL-17 production by human MCs [19,23,45,47,48,53,54], but only a single study hitherto detected IL-17+ murine MCs, and this required culture of the cells in vitro [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Other studies suggest γδT cells produce IL-17 in place of murine MCs [19]; consistently, γδT cells produce IL-17 in response to BCG in a murine model of bladder cancer [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In this model, IL-17 was required for BCG efficacy through IL-8 production and increased neutrophil recruitment, in keeping with clinical data showing increased IL-8, within the first few hours of BCG treatment is predictive of response [12,55,56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Since we have shown an absence of γδT cells in human bladder tumours, we propose an alternative scenario in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the immediate response to BCG is elicited via MCs rapidly releasing IL-17, inducing IL-8 production by urothelium and, as we have shown, tumour cells recruiting increased numbers of neutrophils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>It could then be envisioned that other immune cells, including γδT cells, will then be recruited, eliciting an improved immune response (Fig 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Importantly, of the predictive cytokines, two are induced by IL-17 (IL-6 and IL-8), and another (TRAIL) is associated with neutrophils recruited by the IL-17/IL-8 axis, further supporting IL-17 as an important factor in the response to intravesical BCG. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Our observations are important for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Firstly, these data are indicative of a novel mechanism of action of BCG immunotherapy, which could be therapeutically targeted or manipulated, namely mimicking or enhancing the beneficial effects of increased IL-17+ MCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This is a long-term aim that will require a more detailed understanding of whether IL-17+ MCs act as effectors or as surrogates of other factors, and confirmation of an event-free survival benefit in a larger study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This work is in progress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Secondly, if confirmed, our results have potential for immediate clinical utility since there are currently no routinely-used biomarkers to predict BCG responses in UBC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Incorporating IL-17 staining into standard histopathological tumour assessment, or potentially inclusion in CyPRIT, could be a simple way to stratify patients and guide clinical management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Such a stratified approach could reduce the unnecessary toxicity resulting from the futile use of BCG. </plain></SENT>
