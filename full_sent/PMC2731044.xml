</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Chest pain can be a sign of an ischemic or non-ischemic cardiac disease, a gastro-oesophageal or pulmonary disease, a musculoskeletal disorder or psychiatric illnesses, all of which require specific treatment [1-14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For patients with an acute coronary syndrome, urgent referral to a hospital is imperative because mortality decreases if thrombolysis or PTCA can be carried out quickly [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Severe prolonged chest pain of acute onset accompanied by other specific symptoms is rarely a decision-making problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Attacks of chest pain that are experienced by patients as not very severe and prolonged, but distressing enough for them to contact a general practitioner, present a more difficult problem in diagnosis and management [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In a diagnostic meta-analysis, we were not able to define an important role for individual signs and symptoms in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), except chest wall tenderness on palpation, which largely rules out those diseases in low-prevalence settings [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by Abu Hani et al. who found that GPs use criteria not present in classical textbooks when diagnosing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as person-specific discrepancies between previous and actual consultations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Pauker and Kassirer defined a threshold as the disease probability at which no action changes into action (starting medication, performing medical imaging or blood tests, reassuring the patient), based on the balance between risks and benefits of acting versus not acting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in patients with chest pain, the GP has to decide on referral of the patient rather than making a specific diagnosis of ACS [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In fact, the diagnosing labelling 'does my patient have an acute coronary syndrome?', is less important than the action of referral because chest pain patients with lung embolism or aneurysm should be referred as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the grounds on which GPs decide to refer a patient with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was therefore to identify GPs' reasons for referring or not referring patients presenting with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="methods"><title><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We invited 85 GPs in the first author's region (Vilvoorde, Belgium) by invitation during a local CME meeting, by personal letter two months later, and by phone-call after another two months as a reminder, to participate in an interview-based study exploring why some patients presenting with chest pain were referred and others were not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To increase the number of participants, we also sent an email to 320 GPs in the region between Brussels and Antwerp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The GPs were asked to call us immediately after seeing a patient presenting with chest pain, regardless of their initial diagnosis and regardless as to whether or not the patient was referred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Cases were not limited to patients with an acute coronary syndrome, but the GPs were actively encouraged to include any patient consulting with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>All interviews were carried out within at most two days after the contact, usually at the GP's office. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The semi-structured interview consisted of three main questions: how does the GP act in general when seeing a patient with chest pain and what is considered important when referring or not referring a patient; how would the GP describe this specific patient and what actions were or were not undertaken for which reasons; and how does the GP cope when confronted when making an incorrect decision concerning a patient with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A more detailed list is given in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the semi-structured nature of the interview meant that the interviewer consistently encouraged the GP to focus and go into more detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The list of questions was only there to prevent omissions in the topics to be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For each result reported, we provide a textual transcription, enabling the reader to judge whether the statement is sufficiently correct and specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>All the interviews were led by the first author (RB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The interviews were transcribed verbatim and entered into ATLAS.ti 5.0 software to assist data analysis [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Before analysis of the interviews, an initial codebook, containing four themes, based on the experience as GP, was developed: history taking, physical examination, patient-related reasons, GP-related reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Then the lead researcher undertook an inductive stepwise approach to data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>All issues of interest were marked in the data, and labeled and compared with other interview excerpts for similarities and differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The second researcher independently analyzed all the interviews based on this codebook, also marking and labeling the issues of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>During the analysis the codebook was adapted with new themes to better classify themes that emerged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>All interviews were analyzed again using this final codebook by those two researchers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Conflicts were solved by discussion between two researchers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Data collection was stopped when saturation was achieved, defined as the identification of no new codes in the last two interviews. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The themes were classified by the first author (RB) as 'specific for ACS' or 'not specific for ACS' and also marked in the results section. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the background knowledge on the patient, the patient's current clinical presentation and the GP's personal opinions are used by GPs when deciding on whether or not to refer a patient with chest pain. Background knowledge on the patient â coronary risk factors, differences in behavior, playing down the seriousness â was an important factor in the decision-making process about whether or not to refer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>For those factors, knowing the patient is essential. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>The current clinical presentation: clinical examination in particular is used to rule in diseases other than acute coronary syndrome which need no referral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>An ECG was used to confirm the presence of an acute coronary syndrome and refer the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>A normal ECG was a reason for not referring, but only in combination with a long duration of pain and the absence of risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>A gut feeling is sometimes more important than the presence of individual signs and symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The GP's personal ideas â the patient's age, perception of a negative attitude from the medical rescue team, recent patient contact with a cardiologist, past errors â were factors in the decision-making process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, uncertainty about the diagnosis causes an unnecessary referral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Referring older people has a higher threshold than referring younger people because of the expected smaller benefit. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Strengths and weaknesses of the study </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>The interviews were taken very shortly after the GPs had seen a patient with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>This is important, as the GPs may reinterpret their diagnostic reasoning in the light of information from a cardiologist or based on the evolution of the patient's condition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>All the interviews were carried out by the principal researcher, himself a GP experienced in medical research and qualitative studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Being a 'man of the field' and knowing the reality of the situation, certainly had an impact on the interviews, the participants and the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>The data were analysed by the principal researcher, who developed the initial codebook, and independently by a second researcher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>The second researcher was a sociologist, who introduced a broader, non-medical perspective to the study topic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The recruitment of GPs who were willing to participate in the interviews was a difficult process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The prospect of being judged and facing possible criticism may have been a reason for non-collaboration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Loss of time â without financial compensation â could be another reason. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>More reminders may have been necessary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Although e-mail is an easy way to recruit GPs, the response is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the quality of the interviews of the GPs recruited by e-mail was very high. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Compared to the general population of GPs in Flanders, the participating GPs were similar in age and practice organization â single-handed or group practice â but not in gender: female GPs are underrepresented in our sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Our data did not reveal any difference in reasoning between the three females and the three trainees, and the male group of participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Of course, gender bias is always possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>The same applies â although in reverse â for the patient population: women are overrepresented here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>But female patients with chest pain may present a more diagnostic and decision-related dilemma, in which the selection of the sample does not necessarily threaten the validity of the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>In addition, in qualitative studies, the goal is not to recruit a representative sample of participants to quantify opinions, but rather to elicit all possible opinions and views on a specific subject. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>In our data, saturation was reached, which suggests that all important criteria were identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>In spite of the recruitment difficulties, all the interviews were conducted with highly motivated GPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>The GPs responded honestly and voluntarily to the interviewer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Although what doctors say they do is not the same as what they actually do, we believe the quality of the interviews was high [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>The latter was illustrated by the ten GPs explaining cases where they possibly made an error. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Previous studies </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Abu Hani et al. identified the importance of differences in pain characteristics and the 'typical coronary heart disease patient', the patient's behaviour, the presence of standard cardiovascular risk factors and a tendency to play down the seriousness of the complaints by the patient [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>They were the first to explore the kind of background knowledge that GPs used in their clinical decision-making process when diagnosing possible coronary heart disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>They also described the importance of pain on exertion, the time factor and their combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>In our study these criteria were also found to be influential in the decision to refer patients with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Others have found that the 'typical' symptoms of myocardial ischemia are well known by patients [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>This 'typical' presentation creates a potentially dangerous expectation among patients that chest pain or discomfort should be present before calling emergency medical services [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>The importance of 'certainty' and 'gut feeling' for GPs when referring patients with chest pain has already been demonstrated by Buntinx et al. [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>We have shown in another quantitative study that, in the case of diagnostic uncertainty, 26% of the patients presenting with chest pain were urgently referred to the emergency department and 53% were not urgently referred to the specialist [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that about 60% of patients with chest pain were not referred, suggesting a selection of minor or less 'typical' cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>The importance of the GP's gut feeling was also described by Van den Bruel et al. in her GP-based study on diagnosing serious infections in children [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Our criterion that the 'perception of a negative attitude from the medical rescue team' increases the referral threshold is in line with Tod's finding, when it was demonstrated that the referral threshold decreases when the consultant was easily approachable and communicated well with the patients and the GPs [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>Future research </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The new reasons for referral mentioned in our study should now be further evaluated for their effect in a subsequent quantitative study, in a synthesis of qualitative studies or both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, these studies will further enhance our understanding of the referral decisions made by GPs for patients with chest pain. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that GPs believe they do not exclusively use the 'classical' signs and symptoms in their decision-making process for patients presenting with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Background knowledge about the patients, GPs' personal ideas and gut feeling are also important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>What is already known on this subject </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>- In general practice the low prevalence, the early and often diffuse stages of coronary heart disease are factors making this diagnosis difficult. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>- Discrepancies between previous and actual consultations alert the GPs to coronary heart diseases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>- Based on the threshold theory of Pauker and Kassirer, the GP has to decide whether or not to refer a patient consulting with chest pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>What this study adds </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Reasons for referral of patients presenting with chest pain were the GP's background knowledge on the patient, the patient's clinical presentation and the GP's personal opinions and ideas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>In particular, a change in behaviour, typical presentation, a GP's gut feeling, and the perception of a negative attitude from the medical rescue team influence a GP's referral decision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination is used to exclude and an ECG to include the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome. </plain></SENT>
