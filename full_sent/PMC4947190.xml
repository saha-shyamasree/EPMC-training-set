</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mood disorder is a diagnostic category containing, among others, diagnoses such as major depression and bipolar depression [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For some, having a mood disorder can be a lifelong problem and the need to support people with such long-term conditions is a major challenge facing health care providers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In order to effectively manage their health and wellbeing, people with a mood disorders may have to master a range of skills and make lifestyle changes, either independently or with the support of others, such as family, friends, third sector services, and mental health and social care professionals [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In mental health care systems designed primarily to treat acute episodes of care, the rise in long-term conditions has threatened the sustainability of services and ultimately failed to meet the needs of patients with ongoing care management and the delivery of psychosocial interventions [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Developments in information and communication technology (ICT) (such as the use of the Internet or computer technology and electronic systems) have begun to provide new ways for people to manage their health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>ICT interventions have become affordable, accessible, and versatile such as through the use of Web-based self-help resources [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Psychological interventions have been effectively delivered through ICTs [5] while having the ability to reach rural areas within diverse populations and settings [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>ICTs are increasingly being used for direct patient care [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>eHealth is the umbrella term used for a broad range of health informatics applications that facilitate the management and delivery of health-related care, including the dissemination of health-related information, storage, and exchange of clinical data, interprofessional communication, computer-based support, patient-provider interaction, education, health service management, health communities, and telemedicine, among other functions [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In mental health care, eHealth technologies can facilitate the delivery of a wide range of effective treatments for a variety of clinical problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>They have widened the choices available to patients for selecting an approach best suited to manage their long-term condition [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Such choices include: computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) [9]; computerized bibliotherapy, and Web-based self-help resources/patient information websites [10]; online counselling [11]; patient forums, blogs, social media/social networking sites (SNSs) [12], and online self-management groups [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>More recently, a shift has occurred toward making technologies more portable or mobile, evidenced by the recent rise in smartphone and tablet ownership and usage [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Consequently, mHealth has become important for the delivery of health and health services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Improvements in reliability and broadband coverage means greater and faster Internet access for these mobile technologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>As a result, mobile devices have changed the way that consumers manage their health and engage with the health care system [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that mHealth can facilitate the provision of effective interventions and support the self-management of long-term conditions [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Self-management is an interactive, dynamic, and daily set of activities by which people manage their long-term condition through overlapping skills, tasks, and processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>[16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, despite its growing popularity over the last decade, systematic research on the use of mHealth as a means of improving health outcomes remains scarce [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Many mHealth development studies to date, mostly outcome studies and randomized control trials (RCT), have failed to include patients or end users in a meaningful way or considered them only in limited ways in the design process [5,14,19-22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This oversight has contributed to technology redundancy and abandonment rates [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Qualitative research that provides a more in-depth understanding of usersâ views and experiences of how eHealth and mHealth affects their lives [23,24] is of vital importance if we are to understand how people use or benefit from technology and what drives them to engage, or not, with these technologies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>With the fast accumulation of qualitative studies in practice disciplines that specifically reflect experiences and subjective perspectives there is a need to bring together evidence from these studies [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a systematic review in order to collect and synthesize all qualitative evidence exploring the use of ICTs and/or mobile information and communication technologies (mICTs) by people with mood disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We sought to answer the following review questions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="?"><plain>Why do people with mood disorders use (m)ICTs? </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Rationale </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A protocol for the review was published in PROSPERO (ID=CRD42014008841). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The systematic review and metasynthesis drew on methods proposed by Sandelowski and Barroso [26], Thomas and Harden [27], and Barnett-Page and Thomas [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Qualitative research synthesis is an approach developed to make use of this proliferation of qualitative findings driven from the growth of empirical research and evidence-based practice in the 1990s [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Search Strategy </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Due to potential difficulties in finding qualitative research [27], a sensitive systematic search strategy was created to maximize the likelihood of finding all relevant studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The strategy consisted of two search strings combining thesaurus terms, free-text terms, and broad-based terms: one for ICTs/mICTs and one for qualitative methods (See Textbox 1 for an example of a search). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Initially there were also terms for mood disorders, however, the pilot searches identified the inclusion of this string as being too specific limiting the aggregative capabilities of the search strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The systematic review would therefore categorize and catalogue all qualitative health research related to ICTs with mood disorder being the category focused upon for synthesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Additionally, to optimize qualitative article retrieval the following methods were used: footnote searching; citation searching; journal run; area scanning; and author searching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In addition, experts and key authors were contacted to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Due to research on the mobile aspect of ICTs being an emerging field, it was envisaged that grey literature might be a valuable source of primary data. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>One reviewer screened all of the titles and abstracts for inclusion in accordance with the following inclusion criteria: study used widely accepted qualitative methods to elicit in-depth experiences with findings appearing well supported by raw data (eg, participant quotes); study sample included people with mood disorders; study sample included the use of (m)ICTs; time period of 2007 to 2014 (2007 saw the release of the first âsmartphoneâ, ie, Appleâs iPhone); and English language. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>To optimize the validity of the search a systematic sampling strategy was adopted, whereby 10% of results were coscreened (HF &amp; SM/LM) to facilitate consistency of approach [29]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>There is a lack of agreement about the approach to quality appraisal in qualitative research [26,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Therefore, due to the scarcity of data on the topic being studied, papers were not excluded based on quality, instead all papers were included and their quality appraised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>A global assessment of study quality was undertaken assessing studies as being either strong or weak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Strong studies would likely include elements of respondent validation, triangulation of data, transparency, reflexivity, clear descriptions of methodology, methods of data collection, analysis, and an overall fit in regards to the research questions and the design of the project [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Reports were both individually and comparatively appraised. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Two studies [33,34] provided data regarding motivation to use ICTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>For those involved in Internet-based treatment, the interactive nature of ICTs appeared to increase their motivation to engage with treatment and, in so doing, possibly help in their recovery [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Three studies showed how users of ICTs liked the option of being able to choose where to use technology (ie, at work or in the convenience of their own homes) [35-37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Having easy access to information from around the world, at any time in the day, through use of the Internet was regarded as useful in comparison to using books [37,38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The use of websites to support relatives of people with depression appeared to decrease feelings of stigma in both by enabling people to draw strength from talking more openly about their situation [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Young people were concerned about feelings of embarrassment if other people realized they had depression increasing a sense of helplessness [38-40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Fear of being judged by others due to having a mental health issue was a particular problem faced by some young users of ICTs and it became a specific reason for using the technology [39,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Fear of school peers finding out and potential links to bullying opted users to engage with ICTs in the privacy of their own homes [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>People who felt shame due to experiencing emotional problems would put a lot of effort into hiding their symptoms so having a website where people could discuss their emotional problems anonymously was considered a good thing and often would be the first time sharing their experiences [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The use of websites to support relatives of people with depression appeared to decrease feelings of stigma and support their mental health [41]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The results of our metasynthesis reflected these uses but also highlight a number of intrinsic factors affecting peopleâs use of ICTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>People were motivated to use ICTs to aid recovery, associated with the convenience afforded to them through using the technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The privacy and choice of communication methods of ICTs were seen as facilitative and credible options often wrapped-up in cost-effective and user-center designed products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Seen as a resource, ICT use was empowering, facilitating people to self-care or self-manage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The Internet was considered a key component in providing greater access to health information by patients and for them to receive benefits from engaging in self-help [34,40,45,46,52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>ICTs helped provide a sense of control in peopleâs lives by providing them with the opportunity to access information to help themselves, bettered their understanding about when to seek help, and increased awareness of what help was available [38,52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>They facilitated people to prepare for meetings with their health professionals making treatment more collaborative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Receiving support through ICTs was seen to be of benefit by people with mood disorders [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>ICTs potentially facilitated people to take the first step in managing their recovery after years of deliberation [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>ICTs supported people to stay in contact with health professionals involved in their care and establish therapeutic relationships despite being separated by distance [38,47,49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>People were able to use ICTs to contact health professionals and source health information for themselves in order to manage their problems by converting intentions into actions [34,38,53,62]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>People who took responsibility for their treatment, had a sense of determination, curiosity, and attributed success to their own endeavors appeared to benefit more from treatment delivered through ICTs [53,62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>ICTs that were stimulating to use and interacted well with peoples' senses and cognitive abilities enhanced engagement [46]; this was deemed vital in the context of online depression therapy [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>With engagement came an enhanced sense of personal agency from interacting with ICTs and the completion of Web-based activities offered a sense of empowerment [37,46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>The functionality of ICTs was an important factor in their adoption and use [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>For example, having functions to compare information from day-to-day to week-to-week, track information, format content, use Web-based diaries, forums, bookmarks, blogs, messages, control privacy settings, invitation functions, e-reminders, and options to reply directly to clinicians were important usage features [37,42-44,49,50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>ICTs with increased usability were desirable [38,42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>For example, having a user-interface that could be personally controlled, with an array of images, colors, information, and music options, could help engage the user [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>In addition, being able to use ICTs in different locations (such as, work, home, or on public transport) appeared important factors when assessing usability by the user [37,42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>When designing ICTs and Web-based interventions importance was placed upon managing depressive symptoms in order to support people, through evidence-based interventions, with their practical and interpersonal issues caused by their conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>[50,65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Web-based programs supported users to work on solving problems through taking a structured approach using manageable steps [46,57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>If people focused on achieving manageable goals then it provided them with a sense of completion [50,53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Web-based programs supported people to cognitively restructure, facilitating them to rethink stressful situations that challenged their negative thought patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Web-based programs also facilitated behavioral changes by breaking negative cycles of inactivity, self-incrimination, and withdrawal, which lead to secondary benefits as people become closer to those around them [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Peer support accessed through ICTs helped people to feel more positive and understand themselves better leading to behavior change and the confidence to negotiate changes in treatment [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Accessing Web-based medication information through ICT use prompted some people to request additional drug information from their prescriber regarding risks and benefits of antidepressants and conversely, made others change the dose of drug or discontinue the prescription without seeking professional guidance first [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Having a sense of curiosity toward ICTs and a will to learn self-management techniques and, if an improvement in their health was noticed through using ICTs, then they were more likely to persist with an intervention [48,53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>ICTs supported people to stay in contact with health professionals involved in their care and to establish therapeutic relationships despite being separated by distance [38,47,49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>However, ICTs can be viewed to have paradoxical elements to them; social and economic paradoxes, which challenged people in their social and individual lives [67]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The findings of our metasynthesis indicate that usage difficulties were a key factor in reducing peopleâs motivation to use ICTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>This aligns well with the findings of others, including Bessel et al [75] who identified that computer-based interventions have limitations, such as the reliance on users having access to computers at scheduled times and restricted and unreliable Internet access in remote and rural areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Safety was a key concern raised from the synthesis with the concept of confidentiality and data security being paramount. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>This is clearly associated with the disadvantages of ICTs such as software errors, unreliable information, problems with privacy and unreliability, lack of regulation, social isolation, and in some forms of technology, the loss of vocal intonation and nonverbal communication [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Internet-delivered treatment programs such as open access websites are characterized by poor adherence with an average dropout rate of 31% [76,77]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>There are many advantages for patients when using ICTs, such as being able to get in contact with health professionals quickly and easily, a reduction in travel and waiting times for face-to-face appointments, convenience, and affordability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>The technology provides a medium for communication between health professionals and patients where information about the patientsâ disease, treatment, and therapeutic interventions can be discussed [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This is of particular importance for those with long-term conditions and our metasynthesis reinforces this point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other forms of patient contact, ICTs provide the opportunity for asynchronous communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>eHealth holds the potential to enable patients to better manage their long-term health conditions through the use of technology [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Our metasynthesis identified that people used ICTs to acquire relevant knowledge in regards to their mental health issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>This can be linked to an increasing trend in society to adopt self-service models of interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>There have been promising results for using computers to deliver self-management programs to patients with long-term conditions in health-supported settings showing potential for changing health behavior and improving clinical outcomes [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Since 2005, interest in the Internet as a vehicle to disseminate interventions designed to treat and prevent mental disorders, including those targeted at depression, has been increasing [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Passive psychoeducational information might be an effective intervention for depression when employed with reminders and involving minimal information [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>In their systematic review, Griffiths et al [11] identified that the Internet was highly effective and facilitative when used to deliver mental health interventions with or without practitioner guidance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Web-based CBT has also been shown to provide small benefits when used to help manage chronic pain [79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>However, in a recent meta-analysis of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) by So et al [9] only short-term reductions in symptoms were noted, long-term follow-up and functional improvement were not significant and there was a recommendation that the clinical usefulness of cCBT should be reconsidered downward in terms of methodological validity and practical implementation [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further research is required to help understand peoplesâ self-service approach to accessing Web-based health information and their acceptability and use of Web-based therapeutic interventions [80]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Outcome data from RCTs and meta-analyses have identified the cost-effectiveness and clinical efficacy of mental health programs delivered via ICTs with comparable effect sizes to face-to-face treatment [14,81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Web-based interventions have also highlighted positive effects on patient empowerment and self-efficacy including people with physical health conditions such as cancer [82,83]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Our metasynthesis suggests similar outcomes for people with mood disorder and that ICTs can provide opportunities for help seeking and support for such people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Yet, evidence points to the variable quality of information and apps available on the Internet [7,84-87]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>There appear to be numerous health-related websites with limited availability of help, containing information that can be difficult to read and incomplete [85,86]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Our metasynthesis identified that people with mood disorder were using ICTs to give and receive social support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>This corresponds with evidence from SNS use and associated indices of psychological well-being relating to a personsâ sense of self-worth, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, and other psychological development measures [88]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The metasynthesis identified that people with mood disorder where using social networks in a similar way as suggested by Cohen [89] by providing platforms to give and receive social support in the form of informational support, instrumental support, and emotional support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The metasynthesis highlighted how ICTs facilitate people with mood disorder to communicate with others, corresponding to previous work undertaken regarding Web-based disinhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Suler [90] suggests that a number of factors can loosen psychological barriers allowing for inhibition to become reduced when on the Internet: invisibility, dissociative anonymity, synchronicity, dissociative imagination, solipsistic introjections, and minimizing authority. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>People use social networking sites (SNSs) for their sociability function to maintain relationships with on and offline friends over varying distances [91] attending to extended social networks and relationships [92,93]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Before the development of popular Web-based SNSs such as Facebook, Skinner and Zack [94] had already identified that barriers to communication were being overcome through using the Internet and as a result people were getting help in ways convenient to them. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Of particular importance was the lack of qualitative research being undertaken in this field as evidenced by only one paper retrieved specifically reporting on mICTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>To date, patients or end uses have not been sufficiently included in the design of software applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The same applies to the selection of relevant and appropriate outcome measures in effectiveness studies such as RCTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>These omissions have contributed to redundancy and the abandonment of technology. n fact, there has been a presumption that those designing technology and undertaking research already know what the user wants in terms of software and hardware. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Designers have, jumped ahead, and designed apps and websites, without first talking to end users about how they use and fit technology into both their existing lives and what would help them manage their lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Qualitative research, which provides a more in-depth understanding of usersâ views and experiences is of vital importance if we are to understand how people use or benefit from technology and what drives them to engage, or not, with these technologies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Recommendations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Research: research relating to how people with mood disorder used ICTs was lacking and in particular, their use of mICTs, not as participants in research studies, but as ubiquitous technology in their everyday lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Qualitative research is required to help understand how mICTs fit into peopleâs lives both in general but also more specifically in relation to their mood disorders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Practice: clinical practice could be supported through understanding how people with mood disorder use mICTs to look after themselves providing clinicians with valuable information to help harness peoplesâ mICTs for use in their recovery and inform the future design of technology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Strengths and Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>The review relied exclusively upon English language publications, which may not adequately reflect the user experiences and perceptions that were gathered in non-English speaking contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Another issue may relate to the quality of primary data sources and the quality of existing quality appraisal tools for metasyntheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>The researcherâs stance was clearly set out in the study providing rationales for the choice of methodology and methods used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Transparency was achieved by clearly detailing the synthesis process and checks and balances were used to ensure rigor throughout. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>The study originally set out to synthesis all qualitative articles regarding people with mood disorder and mICT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, as only one article met the original inclusion criteria for mobile technology a synthesis of this material was not possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>However, our novel approach toward the search and retrieval of data allowed us to catalogue all qualitative data related to health and ICTs including data of relevance to mICTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>This process provided us with the opportunity to restructure our inclusion criteria and make use of the data that would have otherwise been neglected in other systematic reviews and metasyntheses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The metasynthesis of people with mood disorders and their use of ICTs has provided a tentative understanding into their uses, challenges, and gratifications spanning the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and through into wider society. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>The typology of findings and analytical framework highlights the connections and interrelationships between analytical themes and subcategories; the intrinsic and extrinsic nature of use and the embedded characteristics of the technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Our metasynthesis has identified that people can use ICTs in novel ways to help them manage their lives and health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>People use ICTs to support motivation, for their convenience, to help decrease feelings of stigma, their facilitative capabilities, enhance privacy, credibility, and cost effectiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>ICTs support people to access the Internet to get what they need in a way that fits into their lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>ICTs are a resource for communication and promote user engagement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>However, they are not without issue, with particular challenges of trust and confidentially requiring to be negotiated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>That being said, when the challenges are navigated successfully, people are able access opportunities to manage their mood disorder by acquiring relevant knowledge, engage in help-seeking behavior, receive support, gain a sense of control, learn time management techniques, take responsibility, and increase their awareness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>ICTs also allow access to Web-based social networks where sharing with others can facilitate social support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Our typology of findings creates an empirical basis to help guide and harness the potential of (m)ICTs to support self-management, facilitate collaborative, person-centered care, and support the person actively recover from their mood disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our metasynthesis has highlighted a gap in the evidence base, as no research has focused specifically on mICT use by people with mood disorder. </plain></SENT>
