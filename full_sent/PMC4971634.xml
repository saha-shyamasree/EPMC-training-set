<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the first ESA crewmember completed an LDM in 2006, the ESA countermeasure program has strived to provide efficient protection against decreases in body mass, muscle strength, bone mass, and aerobic capacity within the operational constraints of the ISS environment and the changing availability of on-board exercise devices. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased or unchanged absolute exercise workloads in-flight would appear contradictory to typical post-flight reductions in muscle mass and strength, and cardiovascular capacity following LDMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, increased absolute in-flight workloads are not directly linked to changes in exercise capacity as they likely also reflect the planned, conservative loading early in the mission to allow adaption to µG exercise, including personal comfort issues with novel exercise hardware (e.g. the treadmill harness). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On April 12, 1961, aboard Vostok 1, Yuri Gagarin completed a single orbit of the Earth and, in the process, achieved the first ever human space flight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 108 min between launch and landing, he spent approximately 89 min in orbit and thus also became the first human to experience a sustained period of the unique environment that is microgravity (µG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>More than 50 years have passed since Gagarin’s flight, and in that time, over 500 people have flown in space, a permanent, multi-occupancy habitat in the form of the ISS has been built, and it is now routine for astronauts to participate in long-duration missions (LDM), during which they live and work in µG for periods of around 6 months. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The increase in astronaut numbers and the length of missions, and the resulting rapid increase in the total number of man-days in space—over 2000 per year on ISS—have also revealed the profound multi-system changes that take place in the human body as it adapts to µG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This adaptation, frequently referred to as de-conditioning, because the changes that occur are unfavourable for life in Earth’s gravitational environment, is associated with reductions in bone mass, muscle volume and strength, and cardiovascular capacity, and changes to blood pressure regulation and vestibular and sensorimotor function [1–7], while publically, the effects of LDMs are characterised by post-flight images of markedly weakened crewmembers struggling to walk and occasionally fainting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The recent situation is, however, considerably different. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on post-flight observations of the physiological adaptation to µG and the large body of knowledge concerning the effects of different types of exercise on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, great progress has been made in in-flight exercise devices and exercise program designs, which, together, have become increasingly effective in countering µG-induced adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Recent data from some (but not all) ISS crewmembers, who have had access to the latest generation of devices and followed prescribed and intense training regimes during LDMs, show little or no change in bone mass [8] and cardiovascular capacity [2], while the decreases in muscular force production are becoming progressively smaller [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although countermeasures have become more effective over the past decade, there are differences between ISS international partner countermeasure concepts [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For experiments conducted with ESA crewmembers, who serve as volunteers for the majority of ESA human physiology experiments on ISS, the influence of the ESA countermeasure program may be critical for interpreting scientific results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The design of exercise devices for use in space must consider several important factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>First, the absence of the effects of gravity, and thus object and body weight, must be accounted for in devices designed for exercises that rely in part (e.g. weight-lifting) or entirely (e.g. running) on body weight for their exercise stimulus [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For a weight-lifting/resistance device, this means that the load capacity of the device must provide sufficient maximal loading for the strongest crewmembers performing exercises with a significant body weight component, such as the squat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>For running exercise, the crewmember must be restrained in a manner that creates ground reaction forces comparable to running on Earth [10], but also allows for the natural rise and fall of the body’s centre of mass during the gait cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Second, independent of the mode of exercise, devices must be carefully isolated from the space vehicle/habitat to prevent the transmission of vibration, forces, and torques to the spacecraft structure [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The design of the exercise devices currently available on ISS in 2015 reflects the principles described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although owned and operated by either the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) or The Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), they are accessible to crewmembers from the other ISS International Partners: ESA, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The JAXA and CSA have initially elected to have their crewmembers follow in-flight exercise programmes provided by NASA, although to a different extent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In 2004, ESA’s Space Medicine Office embarked on the development of its own physical exercise concept for crewmembers, including an in-flight countermeasure program for LDMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Albeit bearing many similarities to the concepts used by the other ISS partners, it has a number of conceptual differences, some of which are a result of the unique conditions under which ESA astronauts and the Space Medicine Office Exercise Specialists must operate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Established in 2006 and subsequently refined, ESA’s exercise support concept and in-flight exercise countermeasure regime have now been used for the LDMs to ISS of eight ESA crewmembers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the 10 years since, human space flight has undergone considerable change: relatively simple exercise devices have been replaced by more advanced ones with increased functionality [11], exercise prescriptions for use of these devices have developed and optimised [9], and the marked physiological deterioration that is historically associated with time in µG has been replaced by crewmembers returning in remarkably good physical condition [1, 2, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As such, now is an appropriate time to summarise and review the implementation and outcomes of ESA’s in-flight exercise countermeasure program for LDM crewmembers living and working on ISS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is, therefore, threefold: first, it is to provide a description of the ESA Space Medicine Office’s individualised approach to the delivery of exercise support to ESA crewmembers, particularly the provision of in-flight exercise countermeasures during LDMs; second, it is to provide the reader with an up-to-date picture of the human spaceflight on the ISS and how exercise is used to counteract physiological changes resulting from adaptation to prolonged exposure to µG; and finally, it is hoped that it will serve as a reference document for scientists planning and implementing experiments on ISS in which ESA crewmembers serve as volunteers, to aid them in both interpreting their data and designing future experimental protocols that are compatible with ESA medical operations requirements. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Throughout their active career (when they are not completing or recovering from a mission), ESA astronauts are required to maintain an above average level of physical fitness using self-guided exercise programmes that are supported as required by an ESA exercise specialist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The requirement for a high level of autonomy in terms of adhering to regular physical activity is a consequence of the ESA-specific work conditions, in which ESA astronauts spend the majority of their mission preparation time away from their duty home base, the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This results in limited direct contact, with crew supported remotely by the exercise specialists and locally by specialists from the other ISS partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to NASA astronauts and Roscosmos cosmonauts who can spend a much greater proportion of their time with their own agencies’ physical exercise specialists at their home base. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Exercise activities are planned in several phases with specific characteristics and objectives (e.g. mission assignment vs no mission assignment), whereas the in-flight phase, involving daily prescribed exercise, is the most compact and intense exercise period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>A unique phase during the astronaut career is the so called “Basic Training”, which occurs once in the time period shortly after selection as astronaut candidates and lasts approximately 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>During this time, ESA astronauts develop basic exercise skills (e.g. the correct performance of free-weight lifting exercises and the operation of exercise hardware, such as heart rate monitors, and the preparation for exercise following ISS protocols) in dedicated one-to-one sessions with the exercise specialists, and are encouraged to participate in a broader range of physical activities and sports. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In the pre-flight phase, which begins with mission assignment between one and 2 years prior to launch, the exercise program consists of a mix of supervised (with either the ESA exercise specialists at EAC or the local exercise specialist if crew is training elsewhere) and unsupervised exercise sessions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>For cardiovascular exercise, two cycle ergometers have been available: the cycle ergometer with vibration isolation and stabilisation (CEVIS), providing workloads from 25–350 Watts, and VELO (100–250 Watts); treadmill running was performed by USOS (United States On-orbit Segment—which includes ESA astronauts) crew on the treadmill with vibration isolation and stabilisation system (TVIS) (providing motorised speedup to 16 km h−1) until 2009 and, subsequently, on the 2nd generation treadmill (called COLBERT or T2) (providing motorised speedup to 20.4 km h−1) and the BD-2 treadmill (up to 20 km h−1) [9, 11]. ‘Passive’ modes can also be used, where crewmembers are required to move the belt themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Resistance exercise was performed on the interim resistive exercise device (iRED) (providing load from 5 to 136 kg) until 2009 and, subsequently, on ARED (providing loads from 2.2 to 272 kg) [9, 14, 15]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Starting loads are determined based on individual exercise data (heart rate and workload, resistive loads) collected in the final session before flight and are typically reduced by 10–30 % for the first in-flight sessions and progressively adapted by the crewmember during Phase 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Running on the ISS treadmill differs in several ways from terrestrial treadmill running. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>On ISS, current treadmill speeds are limited between 5 and 20 km h−1 (3–12 m h−1) to protect station structure and sensitive scientific experiments from mechanically transmitted vibrations [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Earlier treadmills had even lower maximal speeds (16 km h−1 or 10 m h−1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the harness loading system that ‘pulls’ crewmembers toward the running surface leads to discomfort due to pressure on the shoulders and hips, and usually requires a number of exercise sessions before crewmembers find their individually preferred setting [9, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>As a result of this discomfort, astronauts rarely load the harness system to the equivalent of 100 % of their body weight on Earth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Most crewmembers exercise with static loads between 70 and 80 % body weight, with loading up to 90 % or higher reported, although this remains an exception. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The space-induced weight loss of about 2 % per 100 days in μG [6, 21] is not considered in this calculation as it represents only an average and not the individual change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, it can be assumed that for all crewmembers the relative loading increases with the loss of body mass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Once established in orbit, however, running speeds tend to be faster than those for terrestrial running, which is likely due to the lower relative vertical load. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Physiologically, this may be advantageous, as higher running speeds and thus a greater number of contacts with the running surface may compensate for the lack of gravitational loading [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested [10] that higher running speeds, which result in greater ground reaction forces and thus greater mechanical loads on the musculoskeletal system, may be beneficial in stimulating bone formation in µG. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Some crewmembers report needing to actively pull their body towards the pedals (personal communication), causing them to become exhausted more quickly than when performing cycle ergometry on Earth at a similar power output. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this are not yet fully understood, but may be related to both biomechanical (resulting from the unique posture) and physiological (resulting from µG) factors, and require further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Although high-intensity exercise may well be required to meet the physical demands of returning into Earth’s gravity, there are in-flight limitations for increasing training loads beyond current values related to both technical hardware capability and discomfort associated with using it (e.g. vertical loading imposed by the T2 harness). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>For CEVIS exercise, crew discomfort has not been reported in relation to crew restraining themselves to the back plate, but only that, as described above, exercise can be more physically demanding that is expected based on the workloads prescribed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This issue might be related to the need to push the peddles downwards without gravitational support, which requires bracing/restraining the body to the CEVIS structure, whilst also having to the pull-up on the peddles and thus increasing the workload compared to pre-flight assessments on a terrestrial cycle ergometer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Before the availability of ARED, the capacity to provide the crew with high loads for resistive exercise throughout the entire mission was limited to iRED or simple bungee cords. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The ESA countermeasure program underwent a significant change with the installation of ARED, which provided an opportunity to increase the prescription of resistive training and resulted in an associated reduction in cycle ergometer and treadmill exercise during subsequent missions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, post-ARED, the contribution of resistive and cardiovascular exercise sessions to the overall in-flight prescription remains relatively balanced (44 vs 56 %). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>As a result of technical developments over the past decade, data format, quality, and completeness have changed, which have limited direct comparisons, for example, between different hardware [9, 11, 15, 16, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This situation has improved with hardware developments, especially for the most recent missions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>As such, ARED replaced iRED, T2 replaced TVIS, and BD-2 replaced BD-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Older devices experienced frequent failure [22] resulting in restrictions that led to alterations to the in-flight countermeasure plan and the loss of exercise sessions, but reliability has also improved with the latest generation of hardware. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The presented data is thus affected by this development process, resulting in crew performance being influenced not only by the individual response to µG and in-flight exercise, but also by technical conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>There are several other issues that affect the comparability of data from different missions, including exercise being discontinued by crewmembers for personal reasons, or due to hardware failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In the case of the latter, crew were required to manually report training loads, which they were not specifically trained for, nor did they receive additional time in their already busy schedule to do so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Finally, despite only a relatively low (n = 8) number of ESA LDMs, and those missions spanning a long period of time during which several exercise hardware changes occurred (i.e. TVIS and T2 for treadmill running, iRED and ARED for resistive training), all data were included in the load progression comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>As the maximal loading capabilities of these devices was different and crewmembers using older devices could not reach the high training loads available to crewmembers during more recent missions, ideally, these data should have been analysed separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>However, this was not possible due to the need to preserve the anonymity of the individual crewmembers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Summary and outlook </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Despite exposure to µG and the associated degeneration of muscles and the cardiovascular system as reported in the literature, ESA’s eight ISS LDM crewmembers increased their in-flight exercise workload during their missions, with the exception of heal raises and cycle ergometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This might indicate an improvement in-flight exercise performance, but likely also reflects, in part, the planned, conservative loading early in flight to allow adaption to µG exercise and thus should be investigated using available in-flight, and pre- and post-flight direct performance assessments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Additional factors, including comfort during exercise, hardware capabilities and mission profile, also affect the in-flight exercise program and exercise loading progression rates of individual crewmembers, and may thus indicate a link between crew performance and technical hardware capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Crew performance measurements reflecting the efficiency of the in-flight countermeasure program, especially in relation to returning into Earth’s gravity, need to be analysed not only in terms of in-flight loading, but also by comparing pre- and post-mission physical performance and medical data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>This will be the subject of future publications by ESA’s Space Medicine Office. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The focus of this paper was to present a comprehensive overview of the in-flight countermeasure strategy applied with ESA crewmembers during ISS LDMs, with the aim of providing a reference for human physiology experiments conducted during these missions and to serve as a basis for future investigations of astronaut physical performance in µG. </plain></SENT>
