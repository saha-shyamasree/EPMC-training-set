</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria, are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>During the probing phase prior to the blood meal, sporozoites are injected into the skin of the mammalian host [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The motile sporozoites actively migrate in the skin, enter the peripheral blood circulation, and then rapidly reach the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Sporozoites invade hepatocytes by forming a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) [2], where they transform into replicative exo-erythrocytic forms (EEFs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>After intense multiplication during 2–6 days, depending on the Plasmodium species, mature EEFs release thousands of merozoites, which invade erythrocytes and initiate the pathogenic blood stage cycle [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium sporozoites are formed inside oocysts in the mosquito midgut, but become fully infective only after colonization of the insect salivary glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This maturation process is associated with the up-regulation of a specific subset of genes, referred to as Up-regulated in Infective Sporozoites (UIS) genes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Regulation of gene expression in Plasmodium remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Genome sequencing data initially revealed a paucity of specific transcription factors in Plasmodium [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recently however, a family of genes related to the plant Apetala-2 (AP2) transcription factors has been identified in Plasmodium and related apicomplexan parasites [6], [7], and proposed to play a central role during life cycle progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies have demonstrated vital roles of two stage-specific AP2 factors in Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria parasite widely used as a model [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>One of these factors, the AP2-Sp transcription factor, is required during sporozoite differentiation and binds to a specific DNA sequence found in the promoter region of many genes expressed in sporozoites, including, but not restricted to, UIS genes [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, genes containing AP2-Sp binding sites are associated with a wide range of biological processes, such as sporozoite formation, host cell invasion or liver stage development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This observation strongly suggests that additional mechanisms participate in the fine-tuning of gene expression during sporozoite development and stage conversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Another factor, called SLARP or SAP1, controls the expression of a subset of genes in sporozoites, and plays a critical role during intrahepatic development of the parasite [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>It is still unclear whether SLARP/SAP1 acts on a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The cellular localization of SLARP/SAP1 remains controversial [10], [11], and the absence of any domain known to bind nucleic acids suggests an indirect role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>More recently, Zhang and colleagues reported that the protein kinase IK2, initially termed UIS1 [4], controls global gene expression in sporozoites at a post-transcriptional level [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>IK2 phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha and down-regulates protein synthesis [12], [13]. P. berghei lacking UIS1/IK2 display a partial loss of infectivity associated with premature transformation of sporozoites in the mosquito salivary glands [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The contribution of RNA-binding prxoteins in translational regulation has not been studied in sporozoites yet, but has been well characterized in Plasmodium sexual stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In female gametocytes, many transcripts encoding ookinete proteins are translationally repressed by a DEAD-box RNA helicase called DOZI, which binds to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs such as P28 and blocks their translation until occurrence of gamete fertilization and differentiation into a zygote and ookinete [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Whether DOZI plays a role in sporozoites is not known, but other RNA-binding proteins may participate in translational regulation in sporozoites, including members of the Puf-family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Puf proteins are evolutionary conserved in eukaryotes and are characterized by the presence of a RNA-binding Puf domain, named after the Drosophila melanogaster protein Pumilio and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein fem-3 binding factor (FBF), and consisting of eight imperfect repeats of 36 amino acids (PFAM: PF00806) [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Puf proteins typically bind to the 3′ UTR of target mRNAs and repress their translation or induce their degradation (reviewed in [18] and [19]). Plasmodium parasites possess two genes encoding proteins with Puf domains, Puf1 and Puf2 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In P. falciparum, both Puf1 (PFE0935c) and Puf2 (PFD0825c) are differentially expressed in gametocytes [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Targeted gene disruption in P. falciparum recently revealed a role of PfPuf2 in repressing gametocytogenesis and male gametocyte differentiation in the human malaria parasite [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Whether the Puf2 protein plays additional, perhaps vital, roles in subsequent life cycle stages remains to be shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, microarray data indicate that Puf2 is most highly expressed in P. falciparum sporozoites [23], and in P. berghei, expression of both Puf1 (PBANKA_123350) and Puf2 (PBANKA_071920) has been reported in sporozoites, where Puf1 was initially identified as UIS9 [4], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a reverse genetic approach to investigate the roles of Puf1 and Puf2 in P. berghei, with the aim to identify potential mRNA binding proteins that play critical roles in sporozoite stage conversion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Similarly to UIS1/IK2 [12], we found that Puf1 and Puf2 are upregulated in P. berghei salivary gland sporozoites ( Figure 1  ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This was expected for Puf1, which was initially described as UIS9 [4], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Puf1 was also upregulated in gametocytes and ookinetes, similarly to IK2 and DOZI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In good agreement with published microarray data [24], only low levels of DOZI mRNA were detected in P. berghei sporozoites ( Figure 1 ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Puf1 and Puf2, DOZI steady state mRNA levels were down-regulated in infectious salivary gland-associated sporozoites resulting in ∼100 fold lower levels in the latent transmission stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Together, the expression profiling indicated that both Puf members could play a role in sporozoite stage conversion, as has been described previously for the eIF2alpha kinase UIS1/IK2 [12]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium sporozoites must persist and remain infectious within the salivary glands of the mosquito for many days until they are eventually transmitted to a mammalian host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Inside the warm-blooded host they need to quickly leave the site of deposition in order to travel to the liver, invade hepatocytes and differentiate into liver stages [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The transient developmental arrest of sporozoites inside mosquito salivary glands, termed latency [12], implies efficient control mechanisms to prevent premature transformation before transmission and during transmigration before reaching a suitable host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified a factor controlling sporozoite latency in P. berghei, the RNA-binding protein Puf2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Puf2, sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito, resulting in a severe loss of infectivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Sporozoite conversion into liver stages requires initial remodelling of the parasite pellicle, with disassembly of the inner membrane complex (IMC) and appearance of a bulb that progressively enlarges until the initially elongated sporozoite has transformed into a round form [28], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that transformation of salivary gland sporozoites is induced at 37°C in culture medium, irrespective of the presence of host cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that differentiation into EEFs involves additional events, including expression of liver stage specific proteins, onset of nuclear divisions and parasite growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>None of these events are observed in axenic culture conditions [28], where instead extracellular sporozoites die rapidly after transformation [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>We show that puf2(-) sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito salivary glands, as evidenced by the characteristic bulb-like structures and rounding-up of the parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Premature transformation probably impairs the sporozoite functions that depend on IMC integrity, such as parasite motility, cell traversal and invasion, thus resulting in a loss of infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Puf2, the proportion of transformed salivary gland sporozoites increases over time, which correlates with a progressive loss of infectivity to mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although most puf2(-) sporozoites eventually transform into completely round forms, these forms do not progress to EEF differentiation, as shown by minimal expression of the liver stage marker UIS4 and absence of nuclear division or growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In contrast, normal differentiation of puf2(-) parasites is observed once sporozoites invade cultured hepatoma cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data strongly suggest that Puf2 plays a major role in preventing premature remodelling of the sporozoites prior to liver infection, but is not required for EEF differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The defects observed in puf2(-) parasites are reminiscent of those described in IK2-knockout parasites [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Both puf2(-) and ik2(-) sporozoites transform prematurely in the mosquito and display greatly reduced infectivity to mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>However, both loss-of-function mutants are able to invade and differentiate into EEFs in cultured cells in vitro, indicating that they do not play any essential role after host cell infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>These observations, combined with a major down-regulation of IK2 expression in puf2(-) sporozoites, suggest that the phenotype of Puf2-deficient parasites can be explained, to a large extent, by IK2 depletion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of Spect and Spect2 genes, which are both essential for sporozoite cell traversal and migration to the liver [29], [39], [40], may also contribute to the loss of infectivity of puf2(-) parasites in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Whereas Puf proteins typically modulate target mRNA expression by either promoting mRNA turnover or translational repression, they can also activate gene expression or control mRNA subcellular localization (reviewed in [18] and [19]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Our results are not compatible with a role of Puf2 in repressing IK2, because puf2(-) and ik2(-) share a similar phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Puf2 may instead participate in stabilization of IK2 transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, depletion of IK2 mRNA in puf2(-) could be an indirect effect due to activation of an upstream factor that regulates IK2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Whereas Drosophila encodes only DmPUM, many organisms, including C. elegans, contain two or more genes encoding Puf proteins, which can fulfil partly redundant functions [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Therefore, presence of two Puf genes in the Plasmodium genome might be explained by overlapping or distinct roles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>However, our molecular genetics data clearly exclude a vital role for Puf1 under normal conditions throughout the P. berghei life cycle. Puf1 may be critical under specific conditions, similarly to the role of IK1 in P. falciparum during starvation-induced stress [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Puf2 might compensate for the absence of Puf1 in puf1(-) parasites, but not vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>While Puf1 in principle might be able to functionally complement for Puf2 function, depletion of Puf1 at the mRNA level precludes a hypothetical functional overlap in vivo. In this regard, it should be noted that P. berghei Puf1 and Puf2 proteins are very different in size (1183 versus 477 amino acids, respectively), and share only little homology (∼27% identity) restricted to the Puf domains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>P. falciparum parasites that lack Puf2 show increased gametocyte rates and a bias towards male gametocytes [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>These observations fit with the proposed unifying, and perhaps ancestral, role of Pufs in promoting cell proliferation and repressing differentiation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Our findings that Puf2 inhibits sporozoite transformation further support the notion of a central role in suppression of cellular differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Because of the published data from P.falciparum puf2(-) parasites we did not investigate sexual development and differentiation of Pbpuf2(-) parasites in great detail other than to confirm the previous findings, i.e. an increase in gametocytogenesis in puf2(-) parasites, partly due to increased male gametocyte differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In the previous study, life cycle progression of Pfpuf2(-) parasites beyond gametocytogenesis was not analyzed [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Based on our results in the rodent malaria model system, we predict that P. falciparum sporozoites lacking Puf2 will present a similar phenotype, that is premature sporozoite transformation in the mosquito and decreased infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our findings might be of considerable interest in the context of development of genetically attenuated parasites for vaccination [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we show here that Puf2 plays a major role in controlling sporozoite latency during host switch, possibly through the regulation of IK2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Our results also highlight the functional importance of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during transmission of the malaria parasite between hosts. </plain></SENT>
