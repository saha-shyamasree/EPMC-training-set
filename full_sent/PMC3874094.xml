</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Currently bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is considered a clinical treatment for many congenital and acquired blood diseases (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this treatment hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are used (2-3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BMT is performed either as an autologous or an allogeneic transplantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The requirement for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in an allogeneic transplantation is 100,000 times greater than for an autologous transplantation (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There are three sources for prior HSCs: bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Between these 3 sources, cord blood sample is the healthy and safe source of HPC cells for the recipient (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>But on the other hand the total number of cells derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB) was low and this is an important barrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In adult recipients, BMT is limited mainly by a low CD34+ cell dose (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>To overcome this problem, CD34+ expansion is recommended (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Therefore UCB CD34+ cells were ex vivo expanded and then injected into the patient to replicate (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In nature, HSCs are in the microenvironment, or niche, such that they are surrounded by stromal and mesenchymal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The niche can control the number of stem cells in the body and prevent them from multiplying too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Interaction between the stem cell and spatial position in the niche establish its equilibrium to proliferation or differentiation (10, 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Stem cells (SCs) cannot survive for long outside the niche (12). Ex vivo-like conditions are composed of a three-dimensional (3D) structure (scaffold) and a feeder layer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Scaffolding features are similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>ECM has an important role in physical and chemical signals that are amplified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The 3D environment for HSC niche with helper cells is associated with the basal material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In 3D cultures, cells are grown in a type of in vivo-like morphology and the interaction between them can be done better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Three dimensional cultures in tissue engineering research by using biochemical materials as the scaffold is rapidly growing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>3D structures in tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field and is a new and exciting technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It has the potential to create organs and tissues de novo (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It involves the in vitro seeding and attachment of human cells onto the scaffold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These cells then proliferate, migrate and differentiate into the specific tissue while secreting the extracellular matrix components required for creating the tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These scaffolds have some major properties: They are biocompatible, injectable and biodegradable (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The 3D structure is used for providing increased surface/volume ratio of culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These factors let the scaffold improve the efficiency of the culture. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Scaffolds are critical, both ex vivo as well as in vivo, to mimic the in vivo milieu and allow cells to influence their own microenvironments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we try to imitate HSC microenvironment or niche in 3D culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For bone marrow and cartilage, the most commonly used scaffolds are MBA (mineralized bone allograft) and DBM (de-mineralized bone matrix) (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Basically, they are used for repair, clinical surgery, bone allograft and transplantation (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These are based on the bone matrix but the only difference between them is the lack of mineralized materials in DBM by the acid extraction method (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>As described above, to provide a similar environment in vitro, human cord blood as a novel source of human mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) (18) - unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) - was integrated in an attempt to use as a feeder layer (19-21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>USSC cells on the MBA and DBM scaffolds are same as the matrix for UCB-CD34+ cell growth support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The culture system appeared to provide a different microenvironment from the 2D flask culture and might be used as an alternative model for hematopoiesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Our goal then, understands the importance of the presence of the mineral materials for the expansion of HSCs and the extent of the influence of the self-renewal of stem cells in the 3D culture by USSC feeder in contrast to the 2D culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>This research aims to increase the number of hematopoietic stem cells with minimal genetic manipulation in three-dimensional culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, to reduce the risk of rejection minimal genetic manipulation and techniques should be involved. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>In order to improve efficiency of the tissue and cell culture in tissue engineering, we need to create three-dimensional ex vivo conditions that mimic inside of body (in vivo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the cells are cultured on the suitable scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>To achieve this goal, we need to mimic the inside of body which contains co-culture of purpose cells with the stromal cells simultaneously (51, 52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>MNCs cannot form colonies in the culture without supportive environment (53). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>As described above the only difference between DBM and MBA is the lack of mineral in DBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>We know that bone marrow is composed of a protein matrix and a mineral section necessary for hardness, rigidity and stability that enables the skeleton to resist gravitational and mechanical loading, also has the ability to transfer specific signals to stimulate cell division of stem cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Features of these two scaffolds are similar to bone tissue and were used for bone tissue engineering (54). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional geometry and topography of these porous scaffolds with the adherent stromal cells (USSCs) could emulate the bone marrow microenvironment and hematopoesis (55, 56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>For HSCs, sticky stromal cells are considered as the co-culture to increase the density of blood cells (57, 58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Production of extracellular matrix, hematopoietic cytokine, connection and interaction between molecules could be increased in the small cell area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Therefore DBM and MBA by USSC can be a suitable ex vivo mimicry niche by intensifying surface/volume ratio (59) and supporting the stem cell differentiation and expansion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Finally, the production of nutrient materials, growth factors, hormones, autocrine, paracrine, and exocrine (60) factors will be maximum just in the small location called local concentrations of factors (61). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Stromal cells are a source of adhesion molecules and growth factors for supporting stem cell expansion (62). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>USSCs in contrast to the mesenchymal stem cells have the longer telomerase that cause more expansion capacity and self-renewal in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>USSC can produce a lot of cytokines such as CSF, LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor), TGF-1Î² (Transforming Growth Factor-1 beta), VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, IL-15, SDF-1Î± (Stromal Derived Factor-1 alpha) (56). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>When feeder cells are in contact with the environment in three dimensions, the result is increased secretion of factors that can improve the efficiency of the feeder. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The scaffold was a 6-8mm sided cube and porosity was 40% so every aspect of the six-way area scaffold was 68.6mm2 {(7Ã7)+0.4Ã(7Ã7)}. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Their power of proliferation cannot survive for long outside of niche (63). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Niche could control the number of stem cells in the body and prevent them from multiplying too (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Stem cell expansion out of the niche such as in 2D culture or even in the erythropoesis Dexter culture with abnormal face, or uncontrolled proliferation can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>HSCs niche has helper cells with basic materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>This background material or extracellular matrix has a lot of proteins such as fibronectin (64), collagen (65-66) and gelatin (67) that were synthesized for a lot of scaffolds based on them (68). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Acid extraction removes the minerals thus the protein surface of the scaffold (flexible microenvironment) is presented which is familiar for the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Therefore DBM will be so soft, porous and spongy (45) and the rate of cytokine production and ex vivo hematopoiesis-supporting activity of UCB- derived USSC in 3D culture is improved. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>This is therefore suggested for better 3D culture results in tissue engineering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>This result shows that multiline age expansion of CD34 derived UCB is feasible in the feeder contact cultures without further addition of cytokines. </plain></SENT>
