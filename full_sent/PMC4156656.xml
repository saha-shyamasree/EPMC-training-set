</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs of around 22 nucleotides (nts) in length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>They play a role as post-transcriptional regulators, partially or completely complementary binding to messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in direct degradation or translational repression of target genes [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes, miRNAs are involved in a broad variety of biological processes [3], such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To date, more than twenty thousand miRNAs from 223 species have been registered in the miRBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>, release 21.0, June 2014) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are usually highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>They have been continuously added to Metazoan genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The emergence of vertebrates is characterized by a strong increase in miRNA families, and correlates with the increase in vertebrate morphological complexity [5â7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Therefore, miRNAs may have significantly contributed to phenotypic evolution in animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently, a high rate of the loss of conserved miRNA loci has been found in the nematodes and the flatworms [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This result suggested that the miRNA losses in Platyhelminths are not random events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, to date, there is no report about the mechanisms of miRNA losses in metazoan phylogenetics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Echinococcus granulosus is a flatworm and member of the Platyhelminthes, and is the causative agent of cystic echinococcosis (CE), a disease that is distributed throughout most areas of the world [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Currently, up to 3 million people are infected with E. granulosus [12], and, in some areas, 10% of the population has detectable hydatid cysts by abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This tapeworm requires two mammalian hosts to complete its life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The mature adult worm resides in the small intestine of a carnivore (definitive host) and releases worm segments or proglottides containing hundreds of eggs which contaminate vegetation and water. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>When the eggs are swallowed by an intermediate host such as a sheep, the eggs hatch to release larval oncospheres into the digestive tract which are activated by bile and gastrointestinal enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The activated oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate via the circulatory system to various organs (mainly the liver and lungs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In these organs, the oncospheres develop into hydatid cysts over many months and the cysts generate brood capsules within which protoscoleces (PSC) are produced asexually. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The cycle is completed when a canine (dog, wolf, fox) definitive host swallows PSC present in the hydatid cysts in infected offal, and the PSC develop into adult worms in the small intestine [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although the life cycle of E. granulosus is well known, the mechanisms underlying the main developmental events throughout remain largely unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our previous study of the transcriptome of E. granulosus revealed that 1,452 genes were up- or down-regulated in adult, PSC and cyst stages [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a global proteomic analysis of the expression characteristics of E. granulosus in larval and adult stages identified 22 adult-specific and 263 PSC-specific proteins [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are pivotal in the control of E. granulosus development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In regards to flatworms, miRNAs have been experimentally identified in Schmidtea mediterranea [18, 19], Schistosoma japonicum [20â22] and Schistosoma mansoni [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A PCR-based cloning study identified 26 mature miRNAs in PSC and the cystic stage of E. granulosus [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, due to the hitherto restricted experimental methods and the limited genomic information available, the numbers and expression profile of E. granulosus miRNAs are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Here, we used next generation sequencing technology (NGS) to further explore the diversity of E. granulosus miRNAs and their expression patterns in different life stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We expand the miRNA repertoire of E. granulosus and identify new miRNA encoding loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Through comparing miRNA families in the Platyhelminths, we found that the losses of E. granulosus miRNAs may be associated with the loss of ciliated cells, the gut and sensory organs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Of these reads, 73.48% (adult), 73.31% (PSC) and 71.60% (cyst membrane) were 20 to 24 nts in length (FigureÂ  1a), which is the typical size range for Dicer-derived products [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>By deep sequencing, we found that all of the known mature miRNAs were present in our data sets [Additional file 1: Table S3], the majority being abundant in all three libraries. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We evaluated evolutionary conservations by homologous searches to known metazoan miRNAs and found 11 pre-miRNAs were classified into known families based on their precursor sequences, whereas 83 did not show homology with other miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>We further matched these predicted pre-miRNA candidates to the E. multilocularis genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/Echinococcus">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/Echinococcus</ext-link>) and found 82 of 94 miRNA candidates were evolutionarily conserved (identity â¥87%) in both species [Additional file 1: Table S6]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 conserved miRNA families were confirmed as not detectable in E. granulosus, suggesting that the loss of conserved miRNA loci in flatworms is not a random event in metazoan phylogenetics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>These organs have gradually disappeared in E. granulosus and some of the other parasitic Platyhelminthes groups because of a significant decrease in locomotor and digestive activities associated with the parasitic mode of life. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies did not report there was any miRNA family acquired in the Platyhelminthes [8, 9], we observed that mir-3479 was present in E. granulosus, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>This result may be due to the lack of information in other taxa or due to evolutionary innovations to adapt to the new living environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>For tapeworms, in order to escape from host immune attack, E. granulosus produces many components to moderate the host immune response, such as EgAgB (antigen B), which interferes with human dendritic cell differentiation and maturation [43]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since new-7/12/15/22/24/61 of E. granulosus contains six copies of the same seed sequences in the 5â² hairpin arms, these multiple copies may likely be functional, resulting in the dose-dependent regulation of their downstream targets [47, 48]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Development in E. granulosus involves a number of different life stages including the eggs, activated oncospheres, hydatid cyst, PSC and adult worms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>It is a complicated and dynamic process and may be associated with miRNA regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>By comparing the differential expression pattern of miRNAs, our results showed that let-7 exhibited 3.2-fold and 2.6-fold increased expression in PSC and in the cyst, respectively, compared with the adult. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Thus, the observation of substantially increased expression of let-7 in the PSC and cyst might be associated with the capability of E. granulosus for bi-directional development, differentiating into an adult worm in the definitive host dog gastrointestinal tract or into a secondary hydatid cyst in the intermediate (or human) host [50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Indeed, bi-directional development is a unique biological characteristic of E. granulosus and our previous study showed that some protein-coding genes, with high homology to the bile acid receptors and transporters, were located in the E. granulosus genome, and that nuclear hormone receptors, including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and VDR, may play a key role in stimulating the PSC to develop into adult worms [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Recently, the hormone receptors have been reported to directly activate transcription of the evolutionarily conserved let-7 and control the development of larvae to adults in C. elegans [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Here, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of let-7 and VDR, suggesting that VDR may induce crucial miRNA transcriptional events and promote adult development in E. granulosus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, through miRNA target prediction analysis, we found let-7 could complementary bind to the VDR 3â² UTR sequences, suggesting that let-7 may mediate a negative feedback loop controlling the bile acid signal pathway in the development of PSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Recently, a feedback circuit between let-7-family miRNAs and DAF-12, a homolog of vertebrate FXR and VDR, has been found in C. elegans [52] .
