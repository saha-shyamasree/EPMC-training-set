<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In multiple sclerosis, oligodendrocytes are the target of inflammatory attacks and their cell death mediated by activated lymphocytes, macrophages, and glial activation results in axonal demyelination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since myelin-forming oligodendrocytes provide critical support to the neuronal axon, demyelination results in diverse neurological symptoms determined by the functions of affected neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapies designed to protect oligodendrocytes and myelin during neuroinflammation are important strategies to halt the progression of multiple sclerosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The most commonly studied animal models of multiple sclerosis are the autoimmune experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model [4, 5] and the cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone-oxalyldihydrazone, CPZ)-induced demyelination model [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Activated autoreactive T cells proliferate and release cytokines, which disrupt the blood-brain barrier, and secrete chemokines that lead to the recruitment of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Infiltrated immune cells secrete autoantibodies against the myelin sheath, ultimately resulting in myelin degeneration [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The cuprizone model is characterized by the apoptotic death of mature oligodendrocytes [7] and is accompanied by neuroinflammation and motor dysfunction [9]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease in clinical presentation, in terms of demyelinating lesions, immunopathological subtypes, response to therapy, and genetic associations [6, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>A detailed immunopathological investigation of demyelinating lesions revealed four distinct immunopathological patterns [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In patterns I and II, demyelination occurs as a consequence of an autoimmune reaction against myelin, whereas demyelination is independent of immune activation and is caused by oligodendrocyte primary cell loss in patterns III and IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have revealed that administration of EAE and cuprizone reproduces the pathology observed in patterns I/II and patterns III/IV, respectively [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>These animal models accurately represent all aspects of the pathology and clinical features of human multiple sclerosis [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study demonstrate that treatment with 2ccPA improved cuprizone-induced motor dysfunction and pathological EAE scores, suggesting that 2ccPA may exert beneficial effects in all subtypes of human multiple sclerosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Neuroinflammation (e.g., lymphocyte/macrophage infiltration, microglial activation, enhanced cytokine/chemokine production, demyelination, and axonal damage [35â37]) is a key component of the pathological progression of all subtypes of multiple sclerosis and in both the EAE and cuprizone models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrated that 2ccPA suppressed neuroinflammation in the EAE and cuprizone models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>2ccPA treatment suppressed the infiltration of CD4-positive T cells and F4/80-positive macrophages to the spinal cord in EAE model mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>CD4-positive T cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines, which play important roles in the neuroinflammatory, cascade, and mediate the damage to the myelin sheath, demyelination, and eventually damage to the neuronal axon [38, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>F4/80-positive microglia/macrophages produce and respond to a wide variety of cytokines, impair blood-brain barrier function, act as antigen-presenting cells within the CNS, mediate phagocytic events, and damage oligodendrocytes [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our data suggest that inhibition of T cells and macrophage infiltrates into CNS by 2ccPA treatment should be associated with suppression of neuroinflammation in EAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Further, we also demonstrated that 2ccPA suppressed cuprizone-induced microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that demyelination occurs in parallel with microglial activation in the cuprizone model [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Activated microglia contribute to the death of oligodendrocytes by secreting proinflammatory cytokines [42] and to axonal damage [43] by stripping synaptic proteins [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway is involved in various neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and the EAE and cuprizone models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Activation of the P2X7 receptor, principally by extracellular ATP, induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promotes the processing and release of IL-1Î². </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>IL-1Î² is a pivotal mediator in the neuroinflammatory response [9] and promotes leukocyte infiltration by inducing the expression of many cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>A recent study has reported that microglia express the NLRP3 inflammasome and release IL-1Î² [45], suggesting that the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome probably promotes CNS inflammation and demyelination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In our study, 2ccPA suppressed cuprizone-induced microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that 2ccPA suppressed the neuroinflammation to inhibit the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome caused by excessive microglial activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Microglia are known to develop diverse functional phenotypes of proinflammatory (M1) and alternative (M2) activation [46, 47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Previous findings have revealed that NLRP3 promotes microglial M1 activation and that the NLRP3 complex is contained in M1 microglia [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 2ccPA treatment suppressed markers of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, P2X7, and IL-1b) but not of M2 microglia (Arg1, Fizz1, and Ym1), suggested that 2ccPA suppressed the microglial M1 proinflammatory activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that 2ccPA improves the pathological state of EAE and cuprizone model mice by mediating the attenuation of neuroinflammatory conditions (i.e., infiltration of immune cells and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome, respectively). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Under neuroinflammatory conditions, mitochondrial apoptotic cell death has been observed following damage to the CNS [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the loss of oligodendrocytes and neuronal axons in multiple sclerosis [50] and in the EAE and cuprizone models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway is largely controlled by the master apoptosis inducer Bax and the apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation and activation of JNK and p38MAPK also promote mitochondrial apoptotic cell death [52, 53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that 2ccPA suppressed CoCl2-induced apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that natural cPA suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis of neuronal cells in vitro and delayed neuronal death in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results suggest that the protective function of 2ccPA suppressed the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in both oligodendrocytes and neurons, which is likely to be associated with protection from the loss of oligodendrocytes and axons in demyelinative conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that 2ccPA promotes neurite outgrowth and enhances neuronal survival via a signaling pathway similar to that of NGF [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that 2ccPA exerts protective effects against cuprizone-induced demyelination and EAE pathology via NGF-like actions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that NGF exerts a dramatic effect on neuron and oligodendrocyte survival and stimulates axonal regeneration/remyelination [54, 55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>These findings are in accordance with the protective effects against CPZ-induced demyelination observed in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Additional studies have indicated that NGF may exert protective effects in EAE model mice by switching the immune response to an anti-inflammatory status [56, 57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our findings indicate that a similar process may underlie the protective effect of 2ccPA against EAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NGF is a potent anti-apoptotic factor that regulates levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, a common mechanism by which 2ccPA protected oligodendrocytes from CoCl2-induced apoptosis [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that multiple effects of 2ccPA are due to its NGF-like actions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>There is a need for therapeutic drug treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis that can arrest the progression of demyelination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Our results may indicate that 2ccPA has a beneficial effect on progressive demyelination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 2ccPA suppressed demyelination and motor dysfunction even after the onset of cuprizone-induced pathology (protocol B and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Further, 2ccPA might have a function to enhance remyelination (protocol C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that the administration of 2ccPA reduced cuprizone-induced demyelination, microglial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, and motor dysfunction, and promoted remyelination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that 2ccPA reduced autoreactive T cell and macrophage, spinal cord injury, and clinical behavioral dysfunction in the autoimmune multiple sclerosis model of EAE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that 2ccPA may be a promising seed compound for the development of new drugs to treat demyelinating disease and ameliorate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. </plain></SENT>
