</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The koala Phascolarctos cinereus, once present over a large area of the Australian continent, is now listed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species (even considered rare in New South Wales and South Australia) and its distribution range is restricted to the east coast of Australia [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Causes of mortality are diverse, although disease (essentially chlamydiosis), collisions with cars and loss of habitat represent the principal reasons for the species continuous decrease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among various conservation approaches, conservation centers have been created that aim at simultaneously protecting the koala habitat, and instructing the public. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In these sanctuaries, the natural habitat of the koala is re-created and, in some instances, boardwalks crossing the canopy of the Eucalyptus forests used by the koalas, allow tourists to view animals from a close range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Captive koalas seem unaffected when approached by tourists as they show no exterior signs of embarrassment, stress or disturbance, do not try to escape or, if they move out from the tourists, they do it as a slow pace. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, animals in stressful situations do not always show visible reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Escape is only one of the possible responses but some animals adopt other strategies, such as staying motionless while mimicking the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In some instance, stress can instead be revealed through an abnormally elevated heart rate in those species that remain motionless when approached by human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Hence, Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae incubating on their nests display resting heart rates of 86 beat per minute (bpm) but this rises to 127 bpm when approached by visitors [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Similarly, giant petrels Macronectes hallii display an elevated cardiac response to approaching tourist while sitting motionless on their nests [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Classically, an increase in heart rate corresponds to an increase in metabolic rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship between stress-related heart rate and metabolic rate is less clear [4]–[6], [7] showed that these two factors increase concomitantly but metabolic rate remains elevated for a while after the heart rate has returned to its original value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Heart rate appears thus as a relevant measure of perceived stress in motionless animals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this regard, koalas can be expected to display limited stress-response, at least visually, because of their highly-specialized feeding habits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Their diet consists exclusively of Eucalyptus leaves that are extremely poor in proteins and also contains secondary metabolites (e.g. terpens, lignins...) that need to be detoxified before being assimilated [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In other words, koalas ingest little amount of energy and expend a part of it to eliminate the toxic compounds of their food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Consequently, they have evolved a series of adaptations to save up energy, e.g. reduced activity (ca. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>4 h per day, during the early evening), specific, physiological adaptations of their digestive systems, etc. [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>With such a tight regime, the absence of escape behavior of koala due to a stressful situation could be regarded as an energy-saving behavior [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, if the proximity of tourists contributes to raise their heart rates, there is a risk that this would lead to an extra-cost in the energy expanded, a currency that they may not be able to afford on the long term. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Heart rates of freely-living koalas have never been reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the experiment was to investigate, for the first time, the physiological response (heart rate and autonomic nervous system) of koalas to visitors approaching them from a boardwalk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>One inevitable constraint of such a protocol when dealing with koalas is the rarity of settings where we could find enough animals to form these two categories, especially since individuals should be of the same age, sex and monitored on the same day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There are also numerous ethical and logistical restrictions that prevent from obtaining large sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Yet, it seems more valuable to us to conduct an experiment on a limited sample rather than to have no information whatsoever on the impact of human approach onto this sensitive species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Using the least possible invasive method, we were able to compare the heart rates of two koalas in an exhibit area with daily exposure to tourists, with that of a koala kept in similar semi-captive conditions but in a tourist-free area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the koalas exposed to tourists would display higher resting (i.e. during periods of inactivity) heart rates than the tourist-free koala. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Our study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first documentation of the continuous evolution of the heart rates of freely-living koalas, over several hours of the day and the evening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The scaling law for marsupials [18], relating the resting heart rate HR to the body mass (M, in kg) as predicts HR values of 63–68 bpm for koalas ranging between 6 and 8 kg (as in our study), which is much lower than the 87 bpm found by [18] for a 6.84 kg captive koala of unknown sex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Note that [18] suspected that their koala might not have been in real resting conditions so that their scaling law may not be a good representation for this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In addition, the only other report of HR in the literature gives values of 65–90 bpm [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In comparison, we measured much higher average heart rate values in our semi-captive koalas during periods of immobility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This is to be expected as our measurements do not represent absolute resting heart rates: we may have been out of the thermoneutrality zone of the animal, they may have eaten prior to the recording session or may have been affected by the presence of tourists (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Moreover, none of the aforementioned studies provide any information about the temporal evolution of koalas' heart rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Here, we found evidence for a circadian rhythm in cardiac activity of koalas, highlighted by a synchronized change among individuals in the average heart rate values and its variability occurring at the end of the afternoon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>This change is to be related with the pattern of activity of koalas that are mostly inactive during the day and show peak of activities, mainly feeding, classically between 5 PM and 12 AM [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, and apart from Crimson (see below), the evening heart rates were on average lower than those during the day, although bouts of activity led to a transitory tachycardia (but also see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We could not find any explanatory variables for this unexpected daily trend, but its synchronicity suggests that it could be driven by an internal clock under the influence of light levels or temperature. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>If the heart rate of Crimson was clearly higher than that of Nemo (and both Nemo and Nugget in the evening period), its important variability, especially during the day when compared to that of the two other koalas, is cause for concern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>We do not believe that Crimson's cardiac response could be due to a problem with the placement of the electrodes since we could record clear ECG peaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Crimson apparently displayed an elevated heart rate, coupled with an unusual autonomic signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The single predominant peak of Crimson may be a reflection of parasympathetic activity since it was located in a zone close – yet not similar – to that of the high frequency peak in the power spectral analysis of the other koalas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Crimson's body mass (6 kg) is small for a 2-yrs old koala. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In comparison, Nemo's and Nugget's stand at 7 and 8 kg at 2 and 5 years old, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Similarly, [20] reported body masses of 7.0–8.7 kg for a range of unknown age female koalas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Crimson's higher heart rate could be partly explained by her small size, which could be potentially associated to a slightly poorer condition (especially since her heart rate variability is high throughout the observation period). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Although the health check did not reveal any specific pathology, we cannot ascertain that she does not suffer from a light cardiac malformation, which could explain her altered cardiac signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that Crimson is affected by consanguinity (her parents were brother and sister). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In the light of our results, it appears important to evaluate the potential link between her heart rate abnormality and the situation under which she lives, i.e. whether the presence of tourists may aggravate her condition or not. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Excluding Crimson, SDNN/RMSSD ratio, which represents the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities, was high during the day and low during the night. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the RMSSD, which represents the parasympathetic nervous activity, was low during the day and high during the night. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This suggests that sympathetic nervous activity was predominantly active during the day while parasympathetic nervous activity was active during the night. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the power spectral signals during the day were extremely weak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>While parasympathetic dominancy allows vertebrates to modulate rapidly their heart rate [7], [13]–[14], a preponderance of sympathetic nervous activity can be associated with activity or with a stressful situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the latter case, a corticotrophin-releasing factor is known to increase blood pressure and heart rate by stimulating noradrenergic sympathetic nervous outflow in stressed animals [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>As koalas were relatively not active during the day, sympathetic dominant activity suggested they were subjected to stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In the evening, heart rate variability and both LF and HF peak increased, indicating that parasympathetic activity has increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, an increase in activity is expected to lead to an increase in sympathetic activity and thus we would expect sympathetic dominant signals in the evening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Yet, although the three koalas displayed more activity during the evening than during the day, this was still limited to a few vertical movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In addition, feeding and digestion were preponderant and this may explain the observed increase in parasympathetic activity [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s4b1"><title><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Proximity with tourists </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>While both Nemo and Nugget displayed weak sympathetic-dominant activity during the day, the exposure to tourists corresponded with Nugget's having a higher HR than that of Nemo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This difference disappeared completely in the evening when both koalas displayed lower HR with higher variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Whether this difference in heart rate is solely the result of human presence can be debated yet its disappearance in the absence of the stimulus calls for future investigations in this direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In order to ascertain that the presence of tourists increases the average HR, we would need to conduct intra-individual comparisons, i.e. to compare the HR of Nugget during periods of exposure and non exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In the present situation, we were unable to obtain Nugget's HR in the absence of tourists since visitors succeeded to each other within a minimum of two minutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>It is finally interesting to note that walking just under the tree of a koala, as well as the sound of branches cracking, lead to an acute – yet transitory – stress, as this mimics the presence of ground-based predators. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Although based on the minimum sample size possible – an unavoidable limitation when working with vulnerable, captive animals – our results augur for the presence of tourists to have a non-negligible effect on the metabolic activity of koalas despite them showing no exterior signs of weariness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to monitor the intake rates of individuals in the display area and compare it with that in tourist-free areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>We suspect that koala in exhibition area would feed more to compensate for the energy expended in this physiological response, although this can be masked by adaptative processes of the digestive function of female koalas to meet the demands of reproduction [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Similarly, measurement of stress hormone levels, such as cortisol [24], would help quantifying the stress imposed by tourist proximity. </plain></SENT>
