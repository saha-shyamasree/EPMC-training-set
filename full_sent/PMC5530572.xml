</text></title><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Incidence of type 2 diabetes (referred to as diabetes throughout) was reduced so dramatically (by 58%) in a landmark trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in the USA that the trial was stopped early in 2001 [1â4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Since the original trial, many large-scale translations around the world, including Finland, Australia, China, and India, have successfully reduced onset of diabetes among patients with prediabetes and/or predictors like weight loss [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To gain an overall perspective of the effectiveness of diabetes prevention studies, Balk et al. conducted a review of 53 studies (72% of which were randomized controlled trials), evaluating 66 combined diet and physical activity programs (41% of which were based on DPP), and concluded that such programs are effective in reducing incidence of diabetes, body weight, and FPG [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Programs varied widely in design: ranging from 3 to 72Â months in duration and from no contacts (virtual contacts only) up to 72 contacts with participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The review concluded that more intensive programs appeared to yield more positive outcomes, but there was little insight into how other program characteristics may contribute to outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since these studies focused on patient outcomes, they also provided no insight into how to successfully implement these interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Aziz et al. partially filled this gap with their systematic review of 38 studies with the goal of identifying factors leading to successful implementation of DPP in âreal-worldâ settings [7] using the penetration, implementation, participation, and effectiveness (PIPE) impact metric. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>FigureÂ 1 shows the distribution of program characteristics for eight dimensions and two outcomes: a wide range of program designs and durations have been implemented within clinical and community settings around the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Across this diverse array of studies, two thirds reported low participation and 42% reported low weight loss (&lt;4.6Â kg) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Both reviews by Aziz et al. and Balk et al. concluded that more intensive programs may enhance weight loss outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, Aziz et al. stress that even modest weight loss can have significant population-level impact if a high proportion of high-risk individuals participate in the program [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This broader view of impact is essential for policy- and other decision-making.Fig. 1DPP characteristics reported by Aziz et al.âs systematic review. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A red box indicates category for VA-DPP. aWorkplace and primary care settings. bCommunity, church, YMCA, various venues, leisure, and community settings. cHealth care facilities, outpatient settings, hospitals. dOther modes include telephone, fax, text, email, online. eThirty-nine studies reported because one study reported low and high sites. fStandard curriculum = delivery of DPP following a standard curriculum. gQA = quality assurance = use of measures to monitor implementation </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Kahn and Davidson [8] highlighted the dearth of real-world confirmation of the remarkable clinical outcomes reported by the original DPP study [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The Balk et al. review of DPP-like programs reported significant reduction in diabetes incidence (0.59; 95% CI, 0.52â0.66, based on 16 (30%) of 53 studies that reported this outcome) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Aziz et al. reported âmoderateâ or âhighâ risk reduction for 7 (18%) of 38 studies; this outcome was âunknownâ for the remaining 31 (82%) of studies [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The low proportion of studies reporting these clinical outcomes may indicate potential reporting bias toward positive results; on the other hand, these downstream effects are more challenging to assess within clinical settings outside of highly controlled lengthy clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Despite the âvoltage dropâ [9] often seen in outcomes within real-world settings, definitive guideline statements have been disseminated recommending DPP around the world [10â12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Despite large-scale population-based availability of DPP in some countries (Finland being a notable leader [13]), within other countries, access to DPP is limited, in part because of the expense, lack of reimbursement by insurance or funding entities, and challenges of effectively implementing DPP across diverse uncontrolled settings and populations [14â17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Within the USA, interest in implementing DPP is increasing because the US Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to reimburse participation expenses for eligible individuals starting in 2018 [18]; over 1000 programs were listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) registry of certified programs [19] as of November 2016 compared to 500 in May 2014 [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the USA, recognition status by the CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Status (DPRP) requires at least 50% of participants to have a diagnosis of prediabetes based on blood testing (or have documented history of gestational diabetes) [20], though risk assessments, administered by short surveys, are also available [21â30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>When eligible individuals are identified, outreach is needed to encourage participation in DPP and often clinical testing is used to verify diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, significant challenges remain: designing and reliably executing robust approaches to identify, enroll, and engage individuals at high risk for diabetes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Within VA, the national policy office responsible for prevention efforts, the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP), commissioned a pragmatic trial to demonstrate impact and feasibility of implementing DPP (VA-DPP) in VHA, in the context of the already existing MOVE!Â® weight management program (MOVE!) [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This clinical demonstration was conducted in three geographically diverse medical centers [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Candidate participants included patients with prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7â6.4% or FPG 100â125Â mg/dL) who lived within 60Â min of a demonstration site, were obese (BMIâ&gt;â30Â kg/m2) or overweight (BMI 25â30Â kg/m2) with diagnosis of an obesity-related condition (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and attended a MOVE! orientation session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria were confirmed clinically; participants who did not have a HbA1c or FPG within prior 6Â months were invited to have HbA1c screening, which is aligned with CDC DPP and national care guidelines [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Patients for whom anti-glycemic medication (including metformin) was documented within their electronic health record in the last 6Â months and those with contraindications to uptake of intensive lifestyle change were excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>VA-DPP characteristics are indicated in comparison to the Aziz et al. review in Fig.Â 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In an intention-to-treat analysis, participants in two study arms (VA-DPP, usual care weight management program) experienced significant weight loss (pâ&lt;â0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="!"><plain>Participants in VA-DPP lost significantly more weight at 6Â months compared to those in MOVE! </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>(4.1 vs. 1.9Â kg; pâ&lt;â0.001) but the difference between programs was no longer statistically significant (3.4 vs. 2.0Â kg, pâ=â0.16) at 12Â months [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="!"><plain>Reach was higher for VA-DPP compared to MOVE!: more participants assigned to VA-DPP completed at least one session (73%) compared to those assigned to MOVE! </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>(58%; pâ=â0.002) [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>VA-DPP also had higher rates of participation, e.g., 42.5% completed at least eight sessions compared to 31% for MOVE!. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Neither VA-DPP nor MOVE! resulted in changed HbA1c compared to baseline [34]; this trial was not powered to examine differences in diabetes incidence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This evaluation was guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, which was designed to inform translation of evidence-based programs into practice and heighten public health impact by examining impact on domains beyond clinical outcomes [35, 36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>RE-AIM includes five domains: (1) Reach, the proportion of the targeted population willing to participate in the intervention; (2) Effectiveness, the impact of the intervention on key outcomes; (3) Adoption, the proportion of organizations and individuals within organizations who are willing to initiate the intervention within their setting; (4) Implementation, the fidelity and cost of delivery at the setting level; and (5) Maintenance, the extent to which the intervention is sustained over the longer term at the setting and individual levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify prevalent contextual factors that may have influenced outcomes within each RE-AIM domain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>It is a relatively low-intensity program with no diabetes risk assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated a higher intensity intervention based on a CDC-recognized structured curriculum targeted to individuals with clinically verified prediabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This trial shows that having national and local leaders who are committed to diabetes prevention is a necessary, though far from sufficient, condition for successful implementation within a large healthcare system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par71"><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Reaching and engaging target populations is a universal challenge for comprehensive lifestyle programs across settings [7, 56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>There was relatively high participation in this trial (Fig.Â 1); more participants assigned to VA-DPP attended at least one session compared to participants assigned to MOVE!. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In addition, unlike most behavioral intervention studies, which tend to over-represent non-Hispanic whites [57], 48% of VA-DPP participants identified as a racial/ethnic minority (compared to 25% of national VHA users) [58] and 11% of VA-DPP participants were women (compared to 8% of national VHA users [59]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Robust referral processes and networks to identify and engage participants at high risk are essential [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Once high-risk individuals have been referred, scheduling sessions at locations and times that are convenient to participants [60, 61] or offering online programming [62] may help bolster participation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par72"><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The single largest investment incurred for the VA-DPP demonstration was the total average $40,348 per site to assess eligibility and implement the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In the current study, new clinical processes had to be designed and adapted to each local setting to accomplish the required clinical testing of HbA1c or FPG levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Several countries have administered short self-assessment risk instruments [63, 64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Individuals at high risk are then encouraged to enroll in a nearby community-based DPP-like program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The later the risk is identified, the more intensive the intervention should be [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The current study used more intensive risk identification based on clinical testing that relied on preexisting obesity treatment referral processes already in place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This approach may have resulted in later risk identification and contributed to the smaller than planned sample size but may justify the more intensive DPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Number of referrals was lower during the demonstration period than in the years leading up to the demonstration, perhaps because of other organizational priorities during that time (e.g., implementation of PCMH during the demonstration) and there was an unexpectedly high prevalence of patients who already progressed to diabetes, especially compared to the general VHA patient population (43 vs. 25%, respectively) [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This illustrates the potential missed opportunities to identify and engage high-risk individuals before they progress to diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Additionally, VA-DPP relied on primary care physicians to refer patients; however, there were cases where physicians did not believe in the effectiveness of lifestyle change programs for their patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par73"><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Few studies report the extent to which DPP is delivered as designed, though stated use of a standard curriculum is a recognized contributor to greater weight loss [7, 66, 67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The current study assessed fidelity of delivery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Though ratings of characteristics of the coaches delivering each of the programs (VA-DPP and MOVE!) were comparable (TableÂ 1), VA-DPP had higher fidelity ratings for delivery of educational content, goal setting, review of goal progress, and group cohesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Reinforcing this finding, VA-DPP participants reported higher satisfaction for six of eight program characteristics compared to MOVE!. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Together, program differences in fidelity ratings [46] and participant satisfaction helped to identify factors that may explain higher participation rates for VA-DPP compared to MOVE!, as well as more weight loss for VA-DPP, [6, 7] at least in the short term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It is not clear what contributed to higher delivery fidelity for VA- DPP compared to MOVE!; specific characteristics of DPP as well as more recent training of DPP coaches may have contributed to this difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Although there were no statistical differences in effectiveness of VA-DPP versus MOVE! at 12Â months (3.4 vs. 2.0Â kg lost, respectively; pâ=â0.16 [34]), the lack of statistical difference between groups may be in part due to the smaller than planned sample size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par74"><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The challenge of evaluating implementations of complex behavior change programs like DPP is well-recognized [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Use of a theoretical framework provides concepts and language that can be expressed consistently across diverse studies to aid comparisons and build knowledge about complex implementation processes [42, 69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Based on current findings, Fig.Â 2 posits relationships between contextual factors and domains of RE-AIM based on common barriers and facilitators to VA-DPP implementation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Multi-faceted strategies that address multiple domains of context are needed to implement DPP in a way that maximizes outcomes within each RE-AIM domain (TableÂ 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par75"><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Though DPP has been shown to be cost-effective, including when delivered in a community setting [70, 71], health system and policy decision-makers will not implement programs like DPP without first knowing the upfront investment and ongoing delivery costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Costs to deliver VA-DPP sessions averaged $101 per session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In the current study, attendance was highly variable across sites, across cohorts within each site, and across sessions within each cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>While the average cost per participant per session was $46 ($1012 for 22 sessions) for VA-DPP, this cost could be as low as $12 per participant per session ($264 for 22 sessions), if the lowest-cost site ($1410) had the highest observed level of participation (119). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This cost range was lower than cost reported for the original DPP (estimated costs of $1399 per person in the first year) [71] and are similar to those of a YMCA group-based DPP (estimated costs between $275 and $325 per person in the first year) [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>In addition, administrative tasks related to preparing for each VA-DPP session, such as reminding participants to attend and planning the session, which averaged $328 per participant in the current study, must also be considered when allocating staff resources. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par76"><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>It is important to note limitations in this evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>First, only three academically affiliated VHA sites participated; therefore, implementation experiences reported may be unique to their respective settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In addition, the study occurred during an organizational transformation to the VAâs model of PCMH within the primary care clinics, which may have contributed to lower than expected number of referrals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Second, fidelity ratings may be biased positively because they were determined by VA-DPP coordinators/coaches who rated their peers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, this bias may be present for both programs because VA-DPP teams worked closely with MOVE! teams. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that comparison of ratings for VA-DPP and MOVE! was limited to a sample of program sessions and delivery components at these sites and not a comprehensive rating for all aspects of all sessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Third, this effort was done as part of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>National partners contributed funding for the clinical teams at each of the three facilities and did not assess diabetes incidence or clinical measures of cardiovascular disease or risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>When funding ended, two of the three sites were not able to maintain the program or continue screening for prediabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>A strength of this study was that partners and local leaders deemed local activities, including eligibility screening, delivery of VA- DPP, and outcome assessments as part of a clinical quality improvement (QI) initiative that required no additional assessments for research purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Patient satisfaction was elicited via surveys funded by research. </plain></SENT>
