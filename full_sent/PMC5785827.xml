</text></title><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Parasites from the phylum Apicomplexa are considered some of the world’s most successful parasites, present in most species and responsible for many important diseases [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These include Plasmodium species, the causative agents of malaria, and Toxoplasma gondii, which infects most warm-blooded vertebrates and has a high prevalence in humans [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Knowledge across the phylum, however, is extremely patchy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the Apicomplexa is the largest group of unicellular obligate parasites with more than 6000 described species, these are estimated to correspond to only 0.1% of the total diversity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, despite their ubiquity and medical/veterinarian importance, the evolutionary history of this group is only now starting to be untangled [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Phylogenomic analysis based on 85 proteins indicated that the Apicomplexa evolved from a free-living ancestor since their sister group was identified as free-living chromerids (photosynthetic) and colpodellids (predatory) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Apicomplexa was split into four groups including the most basal cryptosporidean (e.g. Cryptosporidium), followed by the coccidians (e.g. Eimeria, Goussia, Calyptospora and Toxoplasma), and the sister groups of the haemosporidians (e.g. Plasmodium) and piroplasmids (Babesia and Theileria) (see [4]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic inference based on the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) suggests that the Apicomplexa infecting aquatic organisms form a basal group within the family Eimeriidae [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by three pivotal studies which focused on the genetic diversity of fish-infecting coccidia from the genera Eimeria, Goussia and Calyptospora (see [6–8]), that led to the hypothesis that terrestrial counterparts evolved from piscine coccidians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although some of the hosts included in these previous studies can inhabit brackish waters and some are catadromous, almost all sequenced specimens of Eimeria (see [6]) and Goussia (see [7, 8]) were found infecting hosts collected in freshwater habitats in Hungary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There are only a few exceptions: Fundulus grandis collected from the Gulf coast of the Mississippi [7]), Taurulus bubalis from an unknown locality [6], and Selar crumenophthalmus, Lutjanus kasmira and Mulloidichthys sp. from Hawaii [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>For Calyptospora, from the three species for which genetic data are available, only one (C. funduli) was sequenced from a coastal fish (F. grandis; see [8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The genetic diversity of coccidia infecting fish has been largely neglected; for marine fish there is just a description of an Eimeria sp. from farmed Asian sea bass [10], later identified as Goussia kuehae [11], the genetic characterization of G. clupearum from Atlantic herring [12], and a description of Apicomplexa spp. from Caribbean reef fish (Stegastes spp. and Ophioblennius macclurei) [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The taxonomic uncertainty associated with some Eimeria and Goussia species and the paraphyly of both genera has been well studied (e.g. [6, 7]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although most species described under Eimeria are phylogenetically related (as suggested by 18S rRNA data), species of Caryospora (infecting birds and reptiles), Schellakia (infecting reptiles) and Lankesterella (infecting amphibians) are clustered in the same Eimeria clade [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The genus Goussia also seems to be paraphyletic and is divided into at least three major groups (sensu Rosenthal et al. [7]): the “dispersed” type (e.g. G. carpelli), found in the gut; the “nodular” type (e.g. G. balatonica), which develop in nodules within the intestine; and the “epicellular” type, present in enterocytes of the gut and kidneys (e.g. Goussia pannonica). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although Calyptospora is estimated to be monophyletic, the genetic data available are still limited (only three sequences, see [8]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Despite posing a serious threat to aquaculture (e.g. [14, 15]), there is little information regarding the diversity of coccidian lineages infecting farmed species or farm-associated fish (i.e. those species that enter farms to take advantage of food availability; see [10]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is surprising given that farming practices can induce increased parasite virulence, for example (i) by selecting for short host lifespan which in turn prompts for accelerated parasite life history (as in the case of Marek’s disease in farmed chicken [16]); (ii) high host densities which facilitate transmission (e.g. [17]); (iii) through vaccination and treatment protocols which reduce the disease symptoms rather than eliminate pathogens [18], thereby relaxing competition between parasites and favouring outbreaks of more virulent opportunistic strains [17]; or (iv) through inbreeding depression of stocks which favours the emergence of specialised pathogen strains (see review by [18]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this study, we surveyed the genetic diversity and phylogenetic affinities of coccidians infecting wild and farmed fish from the North-East Atlantic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We aim (i) to build upon the limited knowledge regarding the genetic diversity of coccidian parasites infecting marine vertebrates, and (ii) to determine if farmed fish and farm-associated fish species host genetically divergent parasite lineages. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The sequence retrieved from the intestine of Thunnus sp. was only 277 bp and was not included in the phylogenetic analysis; however, it was identical to sequences of Eimeriidae gen. sp. retrieved from Trisopterus luscus (see Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The remaining sequence was too noisy, probably due to length variants of ribosomal copies, multiple infections or contamination with other organisms (e.g. fungi). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This genetic distance was chosen to allow comparisons across all taxonomic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, and on the minimum and maximum divergence found between two accepted species in each group, we determined if each new sequence likely corresponded to a species or simply to a lineage within a species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>For example, the divergence between accepted species of Goussia varied between 0.4–5.8%, so the lineages found in S. japonicus and D. labrax likely belong to three different species (minimum p-distance = 0.4%, see Additional file 3: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, sequences of Goussia spp. recovered from the intestines of D. sargus and S. aurata were identical and likely corresponded to a single species different from the species for which data are currently available (p-distance between this lineage and other sequenced species varied between 2.2–5.8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Divergence between the three previously sequenced Calyptospora species ranged between 5.2–7.2% (Additional file 3: Table S2), which led us to consider that the lineages from T. trachurus may belong to a single species (p-distance ranged between 0.2–1.2%), as well as the lineages found in P. caeruleostictus (p-distance ranged between 0.2–0.4%) and T. luscus (p-distance ranged between 0 and 1.9%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In the Eimeria group, the p-distance found between accepted Eimeria species included in our analysis ranged between 4.0–11.2%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, Eimeria species described from birds, for which more data are available, can diverge by less than 1%, so these sequences could be from other species (e.g. E. tenella and E. necatrix deposited on GenBank under accession numbers KT184354 and DQ136185). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, although two of the lineages found in D. labrax were related with E. percae (p-distance varied between 1.3–1.4%), it is likely they belong to a different species, whereas a third lineage recovered from wild and farmed D. labrax likely corresponds to E. variabilis (p-distance of 0.6%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The apicomplexans sequenced from S. canicula were basal in the phylogeny so we cannot ascertain if they belong to the genus Eimeria or a close relative; however, they correspond to two different species (p-distance between them of 8.5%), also quite distinct from the taxa included in our analysis (minimum distance of 8.8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In the unknown clade, it is more difficult to establish a criterion to determine species as taxa remain unclassified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, taking into account the previous criteria the lineages in P. caeruleostictus may correspond to the same species (p-distance of 0.2%), as do the lineages found in S. senegalensis (p-distance ranged between 0–0.8%). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The estimates of 18S rRNA phylogenetic relationships proposed in this study are similar to those previously published for these apicomplexan fish pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the epicellular Goussia (Fig. 1) forms a distinct group, positioned as basal in relation to other Goussia groups [7], and members of Caryospora, Isospora (both Eimeriidae) and Schellakia (Schellakiadae) are closely related [27–29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Previously, Eimeria spp. from fish and other hosts were placed within the same clade [6, 7], whereas in the current study fish-infecting Eimeria formed a distinct clade (Additional file 1: Figure S1; Additional file 2: Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, this discrepancy is due to differences in the 18S rRNA gene fragments employed and the wider range of taxa in our analysis, including members from an undescribed Apicomplexa group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The criteria used here to consider as putative species the lineages with less divergence (based on p-distance) than the minimum calculated between accepted species, implies that Eimeria cf. variabilis was encountered in D. labrax (see Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Although sequence data are becoming essential tools for studying the Apicomplexa (e.g. [7, 30–33]), the strict use of molecular data for species identification can be hampered in the absence of morphological characterisation and requires this results should be interpreted with caution (e.g. [34]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the 18S rRNA gene was shown to have limited resolution in Eimeria species discrimination in comparison with the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This is in line with previous results [8] where intraspecific variation could be as high as 4.2% in Calyptospora spinosa. </plain></SENT>
