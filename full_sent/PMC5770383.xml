</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are major human pathogens and the causative agents of a number of important human malignancies, with cervical cancer being the most important1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The viruses replicate in differentiating epithelia, where the virus initially gains access to the basal cell compartment, which is thought to occur through microtraumas in the skin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Once infected, the basal keratinocyte begins to differentiate and the combined action of the viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, promotes cell cycle entry and replication of the viral genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ultimately this process results in the production of new infectious virus particles in the upper terminally-differentiated layers of the skin3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In rare cases this infectious cycle is perturbed, and over a number of years malignancies can subsequently arise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The viral capsid contains the double stranded viral genome of approximately 8 kb, which is enclosed by the viral coat proteins L1 and L25,6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Whilst both proteins play essential functions in capsid assembly and virus entry, the viral L2 protein appears to be the most important for ensuring delivery of the viral genome to the infected cell nucleus, where viral gene expression can initiate7,8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The whole process of virus infection involves multiple steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>After the initial attachment of incoming virions to the extracellular matrix9,10, there is a structural alteration to the viral capsid, which allows binding to the target cell and subsequent endocytic uptake11,12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>During the process of endocytic maturation and acidification the capsid begins to disassemble, and at some point in this process the L2 proteins become partially exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endocytic vesicle13,14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This exposure of L2 plays a critical role in recruiting different components of the endocytic cargo sorting machinery, which includes components of the retromer complex15,16 and members of the sorting nexin protein family17,18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Components of the ESCRT machinery also seem to play an important role in these early steps of infectious entry19–21 and eventually, through the action of cyclophilins, the L1 protein becomes largely dissociated from the L2/DNA complex and is processed to the lysosomal compartments and degraded22, whilst the L2/DNA complex is trafficked to the trans-Golgi network23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Only upon the initiation of mitosis and nuclear envelope breakdown does the L2/DNA complex, accompanied by a small amount of residual L1, then gain access to the nucleus where the viral genome ultimately resides at PML oncogenic domains (PODs)24–26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Viral gene expression is believed to initiate at these domains and the onset of a new round of viral genome amplification and viral production proceeds7,8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This whole entry process is thought to be rather slow, often taking many hours, although if infection occurs at a point when the cells are about to divide then entry into the nucleus can be much faster27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Virus uptake itself is also believed to be dependent upon growth factor signalling, and there is some evidence to suggest that virus entry may in part be linked to growth factor receptor internalisation, suggesting that there is preferential entry of the virus into proliferating cells28,29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless a critical step in this whole pathway is the initiation of mitosis, without which the virus cannot gain access to the nucleus and the infection fails24,25. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Whilst HPV virions are known to be quite resilient, there is very little information on how long they can remain infectious once exposed to their target cells, or for how long, or where, such viruses might reside in a cell that is not undergoing mitosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In order to begin to provide some answers to these questions we have made use of a model of reversible replicative cellular senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>BJ cells are fibroblasts that undergo replicative senescence following extended periods of passage in tissue culture, a process first described in 196530. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However these cells can be stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle and divide further by transfecting them with siRNAs that knock down components of the p53 signalling pathway, including p53 itself and p2131. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Using this model system we have investigated how long virus particles can remain viable once exposed to senescent cells before they are triggered to re-enter the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We have also ascertained where virions can reside long-term in the cell when the cell is outside the cell cycle and before induction of mitosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, we find that under these conditions virions can remain infectious for several weeks, not in internal vesicular compartments but instead retained on the cell surface in a location accessible to neutralising antibodies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>To do this, the cells were transfected with control or p53 siRNA and after 24 h infected with AF488-labelled virus; after an additional 24 h the medium was changed and non-fixed, non-permeabilised cells were incubated with the anti-L1 antibody. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, in cells that have been infected with the HPV-16 PsVs and transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 7b) it is quite clear that the AF488-labelled HPV-16 PsVs are located mostly on the cell surface, and there is clear co-localisation in many cases with the anti-L1 neutralising antibody. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>These results thus confirm that HPV-16 PsVs in the non-dividing cells are readily accessible to the neutralising antibody owing to the virus accumulating at a surface-exposed location. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>HPV infectious entry involves a complex series of steps, which includes interaction with extracellular matrix, structural remodelling of the virion, and receptor attachment, followed by endocytosis and the recruitment of different components of the cellular transport machinery to ensure delivery of the incoming viral genomes to the trans-Golgi network35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Upon entry into mitosis, the nuclear envelope is lost and the viral L2/DNA complex gains access to the nucleus where it resides in PODs and where initiation of viral gene expression then takes place7,8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The success of this entry process is thus intimately linked to the onset of mitosis24,25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Some major questions arise from those studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="?"><plain>In particular, how long can the incoming HPVs remain viable within the infected cell prior to the onset of mitosis and where do they reside during this period? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Here we have attempted to provide some insights into these questions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Using a well-established model of reversible cell senescence31, we have been able to show that incoming HPV-16 PsVs can remain viable for up to 13 days post-exposure to the target cells, and can efficiently transduce cells after such a period of time if the cells are stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>To our surprise however, we find that these viruses are still sensitive to neutralisation by an anti-L1 neutralising antibody, indicating that the virus is located on or near the cell surface during the whole of this period and is not retained in an intracellular vesicular compartment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>These results obviously have major implications for our understanding of how long viruses can remain viable without the target cell entering mitosis, but nonetheless still being accessible to antibody neutralisation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Using the BJ model of replicative senescence we could first confirm previous studies showing that these cells gradually cease to proliferate following extended periods in tissue culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>However, cell cycle re-entry can be efficiently induced in these senescent cells following transfection of a p53 siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Using this model we first compared the ability of HPV-16 PsVs to transduce a luciferase reporter construct into early passage (proliferating) and late passage (senescent) BJ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, we found very good levels of transduction in the early passage cells, confirming that many different cell types, including fibroblasts, are susceptible to infection with HPV PsVs36,37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also confirmed earlier studies demonstrating an absolute requirement for cell proliferation for the infectious entry to be successful, with only very low levels of reporter gene transduction being obtained in the senescent cell population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of the model was demonstrated following transfection of the senescent cells with a p53 siRNA; this induced cell cycle re-entry and rendered the cells susceptible to infection with the HPV-16 PsVs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Using this model of inducible cell cycle re-entry, we first investigated how long HPV-16 PsVs could remain infectious after being exposed to the cells, but prior to the cells undergoing mitosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We found that virions were remarkably stable in these assays, and could readily attain complete infectious entry, as determined by luciferase transduction, for up to 16 days post-infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>However, by 30 days, no sign of infectivity remained, indicating that virions can remain infectious on a target cell for 2 weeks before the cell enters the cell division cycle and completes mitosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It should be emphasised that the ability of the HPV-16 PsVs to infect these cells is not due to the residual presence of free virus in the medium, as we were never able to obtain infectious virus from the tissue culture supernatants; rather it indicates the presence of virus either strongly bound or internalised in the target cells (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>At this stage we do not know the fate of the virus between the 16- and 30-day time points, as we have been unable to recover infectious virus from these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be required to investigate this aspect further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="230" pm="?"><plain>Obviously, a major question arising from this analysis was; where within the cell does the virus reside whilst the cell is in a senescent state for these extended periods of time? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>We provide strong evidence that under these circumstances, HPV-16 PsVs do not actually enter an internal vesicular compartment, but remain attached to the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Firstly in all assays, we found that anti-L1 neutralising antibody could very effectively abolish virus infection, even in cultures where the cells had been exposed to virions nearly two weeks prior to neutralisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Secondly, immunofluorescence analyses failed to show any co-localisation of HPV-16 PsVs with either endosomes or lysosomes in senescent cells, and such co-localisation was only observed following transfection of the cells with p53 siRNA to promote cell cycle re-entry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the senescent cells there was consistent indication of AF488-labelled HPV-16 PsVs accumulating on the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this, we found that when non-fixed non-permeabilised cells were exposed to the anti-L1 neutralising antibody, this could co-localise with cell-surface-bound HPV-16 PsVs in the senescent cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However when the same assay was performed on cells that had been stimulated to enter the cell cycle, following transfection of the p53 siRNA, there was strongly reduced co-localisation of the AF488-labelled PsVs and the anti-L1 neutralising antibody. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>An important point arising from these studies was whether the senescent cells were simply defective in endocytic uptake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>However in an extensive series of assays looking at transferrin uptake, we observed no major differences between the senescent cells and those that were stimulated back into cell cycle following transfection of p53 siRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Obviously, these studies have the caveat of being performed in fibroblasts and not in basal keratinocytes, the natural target cell for these viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when comparing infectivity of early passage BJ fibroblasts with HeLa cells we do indeed see significantly lower levels of infectivity in the fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately we have not been able to identify conditions whereby keratinocytes can be maintained in a growth-arrested state for several weeks, making it impossible to perform similar studies in that cell setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>However, these studies nonetheless demonstrate an intriguing capacity of the virus to remain viable on the surface of senescent cells for extended periods of time, and it is reasonable to speculate that this is also relevant for HPV PsV interactions with other cell types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results have a number of important implications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>They once again highlight the importance of mitosis for completion of virus infection, but they also make a further compelling case that active growth-promoting signalling is required for virus uptake to actually take place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that EGFR signalling was most likely required for virion uptake, and certainly blocking EGFR with an inhibitory antibody blocks virus entry, suggesting its possible use as an entry receptor28,29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Our studies do not exclude this possibility, but they strongly suggest that the proliferative signals associated with the onset of cell division are linked to the form of endocytic transport required by HPV for a successful virus infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Which signalling pathways, or types of endocytic transport, are so linked to the cell cycle and virus entry will be a subject of future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Finally these studies also highlight that HPV-16 PsVs are remarkably stable when bound to their target cell, and can remain infectious for several weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless during the whole of this time the virus is highly vulnerable to neutralising antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This suggests that, from a virological perspective, residing in an internal vesicular compartment for extended periods of time is not compatible with virus survival, but rather, being bound to the cell surface and primed to enter the cell upon the receipt of appropriate growth-promoting signals is most favourable. </plain></SENT>
