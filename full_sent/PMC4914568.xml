</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the growth of plants that are subjected to different environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, chilling, and metal toxicity as well as pathogen attack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In these biotic and abiotic stresses, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in plants due to a disruption of cellular homeostasis (Sharma and Dubey, 2005; Srivastava and Dubey, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ROS are comprised of free radicals, such as superoxide anion (O2⋅-) and hydroxyl radical (⋅OH), as well as non-radical molecules, like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2; Sharma and Dubey, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Diverse mechanisms have been shown to be involved in pathogen-induced ROS production, including peroxidases and different oxidases (oxalate oxidase, amine oxidase, and NADPH oxidase; Pugin et al., 1997; Wojtaszek, 1997; Rea et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The increased production of ROS during biotic and abiotic stresses can pose a threat to plant cells by causing oxidation of proteins, peroxidation of lipids, damage to nucleic acids, inhibition of enzymes, activation of the programmed cell death (PCD) pathway, and ultimately lead to death of the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>ROS act as more likely cofactors in redox reactions taking part in various roles in plant defenses (Torres, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, ROS have been characterized as primary signaling molecules modulating multiple physiological processes during plant growth and development (De Tullio, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, evolutionary considerations based on the NADPH gene family imply that mechanisms detoxifying ROS were acquired before the plants used ROS as signaling molecules (Mittler et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The reasons that make ROS important signaling regulators are: (i) rapid control over the production and scavenging of ROS in individual cells, allowing a dynamic control of ROS levels; (ii) accumulation of ROS in different subcellular organelles, resulting in an efficient intracellular control; (iii) rapid propagation of ROS-induced signaling from the origin of the stimuli to nearby cells; (iv) interaction and modification of a variety of targets by ROS (Mittler et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, plants exploit this versatility of ROS when responding to the environment and during biotic interactions (Scheler et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation protein A (TypA/BipA) is a member of the ribosome-binding GTPase superfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>GTPases are widely distributed molecular switches found across all bacterial species (Robinson, 2008) and are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including protein translocation, translation, tRNA modification, ribosome biogenesis and assembly, cell polarity, cell division and diverse signaling events (Verstraeten et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Translational GTPases (trGTPases) are involved in GTPase activity that is induced by the large ribosomal subunit of bacterial species (Ramakrishnan, 2002; Nilsson and Nissen, 2005; Margus et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A few members of trGTPases family, such as EF-G, EF-Tu, IF2 and RF3, bind to an overlapping site on the ribosome (Sergiev et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TypA/BipA was firstly identified in Salmonella typhimurium as a protein induced by the antimicrobial peptide bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI; Qi et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that TypA has an effect on expression of the global regulator Fis by destabilizing unusually strong interactions between the 5′-untranslated region of fis mRNA and the ribosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>TypA binding to ribosomes at a site in accordance with that of EF-G indicated that GTPase activity of TypA is sensitive to high GDP:GTP ratios (Owens et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Several studies showed that TypA is involved in regulating diverse virulence-related mechanisms in Escherichia coli, including flagella-mediated cell motility and cytoskeletal rearrangements in host epithelial cells (Farris et al., 1998), capsule synthesis and expression of genes from different pathogenicity islands (Grant et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>TypA is necessary for survival of Sinorhizobium meliloti under some stress conditions, such as low pH, low temperature, and treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Kiss et al., 2004) and is required for growth of E. coli K12 at low temperatures (Pfennig and Flower, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>TypA are widely distributed in plants and are present in green algae, mosses, liverworts, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (Barak and Trebitsh, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recently, Atkinson (2015) identified a previously unreported TypA subfamily (mTypA) which are mitochondrially targeted according to transit peptide predictions in some Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, and fungi (Atkinson, 2015). TypA genes also have roles in pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis (Lalanne et al., 2004) and in development of male reproductive organs in cucumber (Barak and Trebitsh, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>SsTypA was proposed as a new member of the ROS-scavenging system in the chloroplast of Suaeda salsa when subjected to environmental stress (Wang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the functions of TypA gene in plant defense against pathogens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This life style has hindered study of the molecular mechanisms involved in the wheat-Pst interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, to isolate defense-related genes against the fungus, we constructed an incompatible suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library of wheat leaves infected by Pst and identified a cDNA fragment exhibiting high homology to the rice TypA protein (Yu et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we identified a wheat TypA homolog, designated TaTypA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The transcript profile of TaTypA was analyzed in wheat seedlings inoculated with Pst and in plants subjected to environmental stimuli, and the subcellular localization of TaTypA was determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, knock down of TaTypA in wheat was performed to analyze whether and how TaTypA participates in resistance to stripe rust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that TaTypA performs a positive function in resistance by regulating ROS-induced signaling. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>As many as 87% of the genes in hexaploid wheat are triplicated across the A, B, and D sub-genomes (Pumphrey et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Therefore, not unexpectedly there were three copies of TaTypA in the wheat genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, sequence alignment of three genomic copies of TaTypA showed that TaTypA-6A, TaTypA-6B and TaTypA-6D differed by sequence variation and deletion (Supplementary Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>As described in previous reports, newly formed polyploids undergo a speciation process driven by combined effects of chromosomal re-patterning, gene deletion, mutation, suppression (silencing), or acquisition of modified gene function (Wendel, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Thus, the differences in the three genomic copies of TaTypA are consistent with such events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed that TaTypA is a typical member of the ribosome-binding GTPase superfamily, which is characterized by a ATP/GTP-binding motif, a GTP-binding elongation factor signature, and a putative ribosome-binding domain (Kiss et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TypA proteins in plants form a monophyletic group, within which TaTypA and rice OsTypA constitute a subgroup (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The presence of different subgroups within and between monocots and eudicots indicate possibilities for functional divergence between species and, in the case of allopolyploid plants, between sub-genomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In S. salsa, the SsTypA1-GFP fusion protein localized in the chloroplasts, and structural analysis revealed a chloroplast transit peptide sequence at the N-terminal part of the SsTypA1 protein (Wang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Without a chloroplast transit peptide the chloroplast localization of the protein was unexpected (Shi and Theg, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In this study, we proved that the N-terminal region and the full length of TaTypA have the same subcellular localization as SsTypA1, indicating that the N-terminal region of TaTypA does contain a chloroplast transit peptide sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>It has been confirmed that chloroplasts play a significant role in defense responses (de Torres Zabala et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The chloroplast is a major source of ROS in plant cells and is responsible for producing the two signaling molecules required for pathogen responses, SA and jasmonic acid (Almagro et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In addition, a few reports have shown that the resistance proteins are targeted to this organelle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>For example, wheat stripe rust resistance protein WKS1 localized in chloroplasts and reduced the ability of the thylakoid-associated ascorbate peroxidase to detoxify ROS (Gou et al., 2015), and the chloroplastic/cytoplasmic protein NRIP1, which associated with the NB-LRR immune receptor “N”, was shown to be responsible for tobacco mosaic virus recognition and resistance in Nicotiana (Caplan et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In this study, ROS accumulation was reduced during Pst infection in TaTypA-knock down plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TaTypA is a new chloroplast-localized defense protein, which is involved in wheat resistance to Pst. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species can be produced in chloroplasts through photoreaction of the herbicide MV, a superoxide anion propagator (Scarpeci et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Wheat not only wilted when treated with certain concentrations of MV (Supplementary Figure S4), but transcript levels of TaTypA were significantly elevated in wheat seedlings exposed to MV (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This response is similar to that of SsTypA, which showed pronounced activation in response to H2O2 treatment (Wang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>ROS, such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, were induced by drought, salt, and cold stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of TaTypA in response to cold stress (Figure 3B) may result from the excessive ROS generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>However, the transcript level of TaTypA was not significantly changed under salt or drought stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>As previous studies showed, the biphasic production of ROS consists of a primary phase that occurs within minutes and a secondary phase that occurs within hours/days under abiotic stress (Mittler et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>It seems that TaTypA was not involved in primary phase of ROS production under drought and cold stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, SsTypA1 was induced by NaCl and mannitol (drought stress) treatments as early as 6 and 4 hpt, respectively (Wang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Different plant species are highly variable in response to environmental factors; an environmental condition that is harmful to one species may not be stressful for another (Munns and Tester, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This is also evidenced by the multitude of different stress-response mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Hence, we propose that the functions of TaTypA and SsTypA1 differ when plants are subjected to the same environmental stresses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>TypA/BipA proteins are widely distributed in all organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>However, there has been little research on the functions of TypA proteins in plant disease responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Our results in the present study indicated that TaTypA positively regulates the response of wheat to Pst. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Silencing of TaTypA reduced the level of race-specific immunity to Pst in TaTypA knock-down plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In response to the avirulent Pst race CY23, TaTypA knock-down Su11 wheat plants expressed weakened resistance characterized by decreased necrotic area, reduced ROS accumulation and increased uredinia production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Previous histological and cytological observations revealed oxidative bursts during the early (12–24 h) and late (96–120 h) stages of infection in incompatible interactions between wheat and Pst (Wang et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the hyphae of Pst rapidly colonized host tissues during the compatible interaction without any detectable O2⋅- and H2O2 accumulation or HR. TaTypA expression was induced as early as 36 hpi and peaked at 96 hpi in the incompatible interaction, suggesting that TaTypA may be responsible for ROS accumulation and protection of host cells from Pst infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Thus, silencing of TaTypA led to decreased ROS accumulation in TaTypA-knock-down plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) are major ROS-scavenging enzymes (Mittler et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>H2O2 can be eliminated by increased catalase and superoxidase activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of TaSOD and TaCAT in TaTypA knock-down plants was induced by CYR23 infection, suggesting that TaTypA is an important factor in the ROS-scavenging system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Decreased catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities in tobacco resulted in plants with increased resistance to pathogens (Mittler et al., 1999), whereas overexpression of catalase resulted in plants that were more susceptible (Polidoros et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the ROS-scavenging systems have an important role in managing ROS generated in response to pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TaTypA positively regulates resistance to stripe rust in a ROS-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Hyphal length and number of branches are measures the ability of the pathogen to colonize the host under the stress imposed by HR at infection sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The necrotic area triggered by infection of avirulent race CYR23 was used to represent the level of the HR, which is probably triggered by generation of ROS (Wang et al., 2007; Zurbriggen et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In TaTypA knock-down plants, ROS accumulation was reduced in CYR23 infection at 48 and 120 hpi, coinciding with decreased hyphal length, necrotic area and hyphal branch number, suggesting that increased colonizing ability of the pathogen is a consequence of decreased host resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>ROS are the well-characterized second messengers in a variety of cellular processes in plants, including tolerance to environmental stress (Desikan et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>ROS has been shown to regulate different plant hormone signaling pathways, plant-biotic interactions and developmental processes by redox-dependent regulation of transcription factors (Barna et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>One of the most thoroughly characterized defense-signaling pathways regulated by oxidation events is the induction of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent responses (Fu and Dong, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In the present study, TaPR1, the marker gene of the SA pathway, was significantly decreased by CYR23 infection at 48 and 120 hpi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>We infer that TaTypA, functions in the SA-signaling pathway via ROS-dependent signals and thereby contributes to systemic acquired resistance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report to confirm that TypA functions in biotic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Knock-down of TaTypA demonstrated its positive role in regulation of hypersensitive cell death and in resistance of wheat to stripe rust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our results, we believe that TypA has an important role in plant disease resistance, but determination of the precise functional mechanism of TaTypA requires further investigation. </plain></SENT>
