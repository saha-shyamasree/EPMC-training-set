</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Iron has an essential function in mammalian metabolism [1] as it is a functional component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, and other non-heme enzymes involved in oxygen transport, ATP generation, and detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Free iron is also a potent oxidant that promotes the formation of toxic radicals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Consequently, iron metabolism is tightly regulated through complex regulatory mechanisms at both cellular and systemic levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Systemic iron balance is accomplished through the regulation of iron absorption in the intestine, recycling in the spleen, and storage in the liver [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of iron metabolism causes common diseases in mammals that are characterized by iron status; iron-overload is a result of genetic hemochromatosis and iron depletion causes iron-deficiency anemia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The liver is important for systemic iron homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is the major organ for iron storage, and iron within the liver can be mobilized to meet the demands of other organs [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hepcidin, the major iron regulator that controls iron absorption in the intestine, is produced mainly in the liver and secreted into circulation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although many critical discoveries have been made regarding the regulation of iron homeostasis, gaps still exist in our understanding of the details of iron metabolism [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of hemochromatosis is highly variable, indicating that genetic modifiers may contribute to the complexity of this disease [6], and these variations could make individuals more or less susceptible to the pathological processes of iron metabolism disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Identification of such genetic modifiers may help us better understand disease pathogenesis and provide novel insights into the detailed molecular control of iron homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Mice are powerful model organisms for investigating iron-related human genetic diseases [7] as it is possible to perform functional studies on candidate genes under controlled environmental factors with defined genetic crosses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and forward genetic approaches have been successfully used to identify the genetic loci and specific genes that control iron-related quantitative traits such as tissue iron status and red blood cell parameters [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed marked differences in the concentrations of liver and spleen non-heme iron content among inbred mouse strains [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>C57BL mice have low liver and spleen iron content while SWR/J mice have much higher levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This difference may partially explain the variance in response to infection and susceptibility to uroporphyria between strains [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the past, positional cloning approaches have been successfully used to identify the potent modifiers controlling the variation of iron metabolism between mouse strains [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Many putative QTLs affecting iron status have been found, however, few have been validated and genes responsible for these traits remain to be identified [12], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In a recent study, Grant et al. undertook QTL analysis to examine the genetic basis of variability in liver and spleen iron content between C57BL/6J and SWR mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The results showed that QTLs on chromosomes 2, 7, and 16 control liver non-heme iron content in C57BL/6J×SWR F2 male mice [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For two QTLs, on Chr16 and Chr7, the SWR alleles were associated with higher iron levels in male mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for the QTL on Chr2 higher iron levels in both liver and spleen were associated with the C57BL/6J allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, the modifier genes controlling these QTLs remain to be identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used forward genetic approaches to identify the gene(s) accountable for the variability of hepatic iron accumulation based on the previous QTL analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Generating a series of congenic mouse models, we validated the previously identified QTL on chromosome 16 and refined it to an 830 Kb interval that contains 11 coding genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Three genes among these have non-synonymous coding sequence variations, which make them strong candidates for being involved in iron metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Although the in vivo functional test did not identify specific candidates, our work represents progress in positional cloning of the novel iron metabolism modifier present on Chr16 in mouse liver. </plain></SENT>
