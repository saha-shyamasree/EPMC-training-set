</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cancers develop in complex tumor microenvironments, which include cells such as endothelial cells, immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Non-cancerous stromal cells have different capabilities to induce both tumor-promoting and tumor-antagonizing effects [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The contradictory phenomenon brings us a problem how the tumor-associated stroma at the primary sites is hijacked to support tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The key mechanisms may focus on the role of macrophages, immune suppressor cells, MSCs, the vasculature and various other components of a tumor-supportive microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Macrophages are resident phagocytic cells in tissues, which play important roles in steady-state tissue homoeostasis by removing cellular debris and apoptotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although macrophages are classically regarded as key effector cells during immune defense, numerous studies have demonstrated a clear role for TAMs in supporting various aspects of tumor development [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>An explanation for the disparate roles of macrophages during normal tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis lies in their phenotype [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>At the extremes of their phenotypic continuum, macrophages range from an M1 to M2 polarization status: classically activated M1 macrophages have an anti-tumorigenic role; on the other hand, alternatively activated M2 macrophages promote anti-inflammatory responses and have pro-tumorigenic functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Currently, we do not fully understand how macrophages initially switch from being anti-tumor to pro-tumorigenic at the onset of disease [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>MSCs are one of the major components of the tumor stroma and there is a close interaction between MSCs and the immune system [6â9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>MSCs have been shown to interact with a variety of adaptive immune cells including T cells, B cells and dendritic cells [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was demonstrated that the MSCs actively interacted with components of the innate immune system and that through these interactions, they displayed both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Within the innate immune system, it was well established that macrophages were key players in initiating and controlling inflammation and the MSCs could influence macrophage functions [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In a tumor microenvironment, the MSCs are often constantly exposed to immune cells and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They may have acquired functions that are distinct from those of normal MSCs [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The unique features may play a role in regulating the tumor microenvironment and ultimately affecting tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the MSCs could favor a tumor to escape from immunologic surveillance in an environment of M1 macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To assess the possible effects of M1 macrophages on the MSCs in tumor growth, we treated MSCs with condition medium derived from M1 macrophages (cMSCs), characterized by their tumor-promoting activity and phenotype, and studied the mechanism of the cMSCs in affecting tumor growth in comparison to normal MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We found that M1 macrophages could activate the MSCs to adopt a regulatory phenotype, and the cMSCs promoted tumor growth by iNOS and MCP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study revealed that the MSCs sensed and controlled inflammation to promote tumor growth in a pro-inflammatory environment. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Macrophage cell-line RAW264.7 cell exposure to IFN-Î³ and LPS drive M1 polarization with potentiated cytotoxic and antitumoral properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To confirm the M1 macrophage phenotype, the expression of iNOS (M1 macrophage marker) examined by a FACS analysis clearly increased, while the expression of CD11b (macrophage marker) remained unchanged (Figure S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Macrophage M1 polarization was also assessed at the mRNA level using real-time PCR by measuring the expression of several classical M1 markers: TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², and iNOS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>An increased IL-1Î² and iNOS expression profile was obtained by incubation with IFN-Î³ and LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We also checked the expression at the mRNA level of several M2 markers (IL-10, Arg-1 and FIZZ-1) in M1 macrophages, but in our conditions, we observed no significant expression of these genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mRNA abundance of signal regulatory protein-a (SIRPÎ±) was significantly reduced (Figure S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>SIRPÎ± is a membrane receptor expressed by macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The interactions of CD47-SIRPÎ± form a barrier for antibody-mediated tumor cell destruction [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In order to study the effects of M1 macrophages on cancer cell response in vivo, prior to implantation of M1 macrophages, breast cancer models with MDA-MB-231-FLUC cells were set up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Two hours after M1 macrophages had been injected into tumor sites, we found that M1 macrophages exhibited radical scavenging potential since the amount of tumor cells remaining was 10% compared to the control group (Figure S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Therefore, incubation of macrophages with IFN-Î³ and LPS induces their polarization into M1 macrophages, and M1-polarized macrophages have strong antitumor activity to elicit tumor disruption. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To investigate the characterization of the cMSCs, MSCs were isolated from murine bone marrow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The morphology of the mouse MSCs displayed a homogenous spindle-shaped population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>FACS was used to identify the surface marker expression of the MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>High expression of CD29, CD73, CD90 and CD105 was observed, but CD34 and CD45 were down-regulated (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>MSC were stimulated by the medium from M1 macrophages for 24 hours to achieve the cMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the cMSCs could promote human tumor growth, we injected the cMSCs into immune deficient mice with human carcinoma cells, while untreated MSCs were used as controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>When co-injected with MDA-MB-231-FLUC breast cancer cells, the cMSCs but not the untreated MSC remarkably increased the tumor-initiating ability and tumor growth (Figure 1A, 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We also tested the effect of the cMSCs on hepatocellular HCC-LM3-FLUC tumor growth in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Similar to the breast cancer model, the cMSCs caused a tumor-promoting effect in the hepatocellular carcinoma model as compared to the untreated control MSCs group (Figure 1B, 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The cMSCs also led to a significant tumor promotion of malignant glioblastoma U87MG-FLUC cells (Figure 1C, 1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after the cMSCs were co-injected with murine 4T1-FLUC cells into a fat pad of normal mice, the cMSCs were more effective than the control MSCs in promoting tumor growth (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cMSCs displayed greater potential to promote tumor growth in comparison to the untreated MSCs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory response can promote carcinogenesis; one of the major challenges in understanding the connection between inflammation and cancer is to identify the triggering events that lead to the inflammatory responses which can promote tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated an event of cancer development induced by inflammation: when the microenvironment became M1 pro-inflammatory, the MSCs acquired a regulatory phenotype and promoted tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The tumor-promoting abilities required iNOS and TAMs; TAMs were recruited by MCP1 and further polarized into an M2-like phenotype to affect tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>We use Figure 6 to describe this effect. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, the cMSCs could become a potent immune-regulatory component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>A previous study found that the concomitant presence of TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ could induce the immunosuppressive functions of the MSCs, as these cytokine combinations provoke the expression of high levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and iNOS [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In our experimental setting, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were expressed at low levels in the cMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>These differences may suggest that the combination of TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ could not completely mimic the microenvironment formed by M1 macrophages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The key factor of this tumor promoting pathway is the MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Recently, the immune modulatory property of the MSCs has been extensively studied by investigators [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The MSCs influenced both adaptive and innate immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The ability of the MSCs to control an inflammatory environment has been used in inflammatory associated disease, including myocardial infarction [19], peritonitis [20], and sepsis [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In addition to polarization of macrophages, the MSCs could also polarize into two distinctly acting phenotypes following specific TLR-activation including MSC1 and MSC2 [17, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>MSC1 was pro-inflammatory, and MSC2 showed anti-inflammatory properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>MSC1-based treatment of established tumors in an immune competent model attenuated tumor growth and metastasis in contrast to MSC- or MSC2-treated animals in which tumor growth and spread was increased [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, we found that the cMSCs could significantly promote tumor growth, recruit CD45 positive bone marrow cells in vivo, and had immunosuppressive potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, Quantitative PCR showed that the transcript levels of iNOS and TLR3 were markedly higher in the cMSCs than in the untreated MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results may suggest that the cMSCs had a regulatory-like profile similar to MSC2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Previous reports indicated that the MSCs may be involved in cancer initiation in vivo and the MSCs may spontaneously transform into malignant cells in vitro [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It is clear that the MSCs secrete a number of paracrine factors that may influence tumor growth [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanisms of MSCs-mediated tumor growth are still debated, especially with regards to immunosuppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Previous data found that the prevention of graft-versus-host disease by the MSCs was dependent on iNOS, and that bone marrow-derived MSCs could exert immunosuppressive effects by iNOS to favor B16 melanoma cell growth [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, cMSCs-mediated immune regulatory effects occurred via iNOS in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>After iNOS gene knockdown, the immune suppression and tumor growth enhancement of the cMSCs were reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that NO-mediated immunosuppression by the cMSCs was required in tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Additionally, macrophages are the main cells in the tumor microenvironment [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>A previous study showed that tumor-educated mesenchymal stromal cells recruit macrophages via CCR2 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, we found that the cMSCs could recruit macrophages to tumor sites, render macrophages into M2-like cells, and consequently enhance tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
