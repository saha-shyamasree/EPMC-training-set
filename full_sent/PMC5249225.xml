</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of overweight and obesity has drawn worldwide attention in all geographic areas during last two decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In USA, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity had risen from 14.5% to 35.1% in adults [1], which is similar to growth seen in China from 14.6% to 32.3%, due to economic boom and lifestyle changes [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, environmental factors are attributed to the rising prevalence of obesity, too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as heavy metals, have been confirmed to be associated with obesity [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Lead (Pb) is a kind of heavy metal widely used in gasoline and lead-acid battery industries [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Pb pollutants may be released as air pollution or waste mixtures into soil and waterways in the process of manufacturing, which were then up-taken through food, water and air [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Lead poisoning mainly caused brain and neurology defects, namely cognitive disorder, movement and coordination impairment, hearing and visual disturbance [5].Recent studies have suggested Pb as an endocrine disrupting chemical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Pb is not only associated with late-onset puberty [6, 7] but also acts on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, thus causing high stress-related cortisol levels [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, high bone turnover is related with Pb exposure [11].Furthermore, a lot of studies have investigated the relationship between early Pb exposure with BMI and obesity, and the results were inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Some epidemiology as well as animal studies revealed that maternal or adolescent lead exposure caused prolonged obesity that persisted into adults[4, 5, 12, 13], whereas others indicated mother lead level was associated with low birth weight[14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, little has concentrated on the effects of adult Pb exposure on obesity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Our previous investigation from the cross-sectional study revealed positive relationship between blood lead level (BLL) and obesity in adults [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is essential to establish an animal model to explore the underlying mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There is a growing recognition of the impact of environmental factors such as heavy metals, diet and stress on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, especially in early life or at maternal stage [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>DNA Methylation is one of the most common epigenetic events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Some research has confirmed that both obesity and type 2 diabetes were accompanied by DNA methylation changes of some metabolic-related genes [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In one study, various levels of maternal lead exposure resulted in the fur color changes of offspring as well as methylation level changes of some gene locus and imprinted genes that determined fur color [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In our study, we constructed different levels of leaded water on adult rats, to observe the association of Pb and weight gain and other metabolic parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using liver samples, we performed a genome-wide methylome analysis to observe DNA methylation signatures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, compared to the NCD control group, we found the DNA hypermethylation extended along pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism in the NCD+0.05%Pb group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that 0.05%Pb may induce abnormal metabolic status through DNA methylation that regulated important genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>As a kind of environmental endocrine disruptor, Pb mimics or disrupts hormone function at low doses in ways not predicted by high-dose studies [20]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In one study, prenatal exposure to 16ppm and 32ppm lead water caused weight gain in male offspring of mice; moreover, body fat and FSI level as well as HOMA-IR level of 16ppm male offspring were significantly increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In contrast, weight gain and body composition changes as well as glucose intolerance were not seen in female offspring [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In addition, a linear increase in mean weight with increasing pre-weaning lead exposure in male offspring was observed in a study constructed by Faulk et al. [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The effects of postnatal Pb exposure on metabolism changes were inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Our previous epidemiology study revealed a positive relationship between BLL and BMI in China [2]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The conflicting results may be due to ethnic variations as well as different BLL of the study population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In one animal study, gestational exposure from 27 to 109ppm of leaded water resulted in late-onset obesity of offspring, which was not observed in the same-dosage treated postnatal groups[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In another animal study constructed by Eric Beier et al. [11], postnatal 50ppm leaded water ingestion had no effect in either body weight or fat composition of mice, whereas it caused higher fasted glucose level and elevated leptin levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Gestational exposure has more detrimental effects on offspring, probably due to high efficiency of placenta absorption; thus postnatal Pb exposure in rats may achieve equivalent effect as in prenatal ones only when increasing the exposure dosage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Both fasting insulin and glucose levels were elevated in the NCD+0.05%Pb group, indicating excessive hepatic output of glucose and/or insensitivity of peripheral tissues especially liver, which could also be verified by HOMA-IR index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it can be speculated that lead may disrupt glucose homeostasis, somewhat, through induction of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Mostafalou et al. [23]also found that 0.05% Pb level of drinking water could lead to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Whereas, overweight itself was a contributing factor to hepatic lipid content and insulin resistance as well as glucose intolerance, all of which could be observed in 0.05% Pb received groups, thus it was hard to illustrate whether lead acted mainly as an “obesogen” or directly devoted to insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is an important style of epigenetic regulation [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have concentrated on the relationship between Pb exposure and the methylation changes of brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Developmental Pb exposure not only altered DNA methylation in both specific gene level and global genome level in brain of Alzheimer’s disease model [25–28], but also could affect the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) in hippocampus [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In addition, Pb exposure could enhance the mean DNA methylation level and epigenetic drift of several imprinted genes like IGF-2, Igf2r, H19 in both cell model and animal tissues [30, 31], although others revealed that increased blood or patella lead levels were associated with hypomethylation of LINE-1 in both cell model and population study[32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Arko et al. found that Pb exposure during pregnancy affects the DNA methylation status of the fetal germ cells, which led to altered DNA methylation in grandchildren’s neonatal dried blood spots [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The liver is a critical organ for the regulation of whole body energy homeostasis due to its central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as its close connection via the portal vein to nutrient uptake in the intestine [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic mechanisms may partly explain the pathogenesis and development of metabolic diseases, as previous studies has found altered DNA methylation accompanied by altered transcriptional levels of liver in obesity and type 2 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a global wide analysis of DNA methylation in liver to explain the mechanism of metabolic changes resulting from adult Pb exposure for the first time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The bisulfite sequencing results revealed a hepatic hypermethylation of whole genome of 0.05% Pb exposed rats compared to unexposed ones, which may be explained by changed expression or activity of proteins controlling DNA methylation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In addition, a lot of genes involved with glucose and lipid metabolism were observed with apparent DNA methylation alterations at the TSS regions [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>PKB/AKT pathway was essential in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism in liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of AKT may result in gene repression and thus inhibiting this pathway, which could lead to reduced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis but increased gluconeogenesis, thus promoting insulin resistance of liver [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The hypermethylation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation such as CPT-2, MCAD, and ACO could result in reduced fatty acid oxidation rate and in turn elevated lipid synthesis in liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>MTTP and lipoprotein like APO-CⅢ, APO-Ⅴ, and APO-Ⅳ were important in VLDL-assembling and TG transportation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of these proteins may give rise to reduced TG output and a further accumulating of TG in liver [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Bone lead level is a more reliable biomarker of long-term Pb exposure, while blood lead level reveals recent exposure [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated Pb accumulation by detecting bone lead level instead of blood lead level, which was differed from most previous studies [12, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Whereas, it would be more rigorous to detect both BLL and bone lead level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the lead level of NCD+0.45% group did not cause corresponding increase in bone lead levels, which may due to the precipitation of the highest concentration of lead in the water. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Our study has some merits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Firstly, for the first time, we performed whole genome DNA methylation analysis of liver in both Pb exposure rats and control rats, in order to explore the potential mechanism of metabolic changes after exposure to lead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Secondly, our study concentrated on adult stage but not prenatal or developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This made good sense in our daily life, because the metabolic disorder and altered DNA methylation of adults may have adverse effects on the next generation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that chronic 0.05%Pb exposure results in dose-specific insulin resistance and weight gain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These metabolic disorders may be induced through altered methylation of genes related with metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to explore the alteration of specific gene expression and its association with DNA methylation in both animal and cellular levels. </plain></SENT>
