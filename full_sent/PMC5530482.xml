</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy in the world.1 Despite the progress of recent decades, the outcome of patients with advanced HCC remains poor, and mortality for liver cancer has increased worldwide.1 Sorafenib is the only drug which is effective in advanced HCC with an improvement of about 3 months in median overall survival.2 Novel therapies are urgently needed, but their development is challenged by the limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC progression and the subsequent lack of identified targets that drive liver transformation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The Wnt pathway is frequently activated in HCC.3 4 Various attempts have been made to develop therapeutics targeting the Wnt pathway components, and some of these are now under clinical evaluation.5 However, the challenges faced in the development of Wnt inhibitors, such as specificity and toxicity, demand a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in Wnt deregulation, in order to inform the design of more specific and more effective compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The canonical Wnt pathway (or Wnt/β-catenin pathway) leads to an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm that can be translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription factors.3 A recent analysis of human HCC has shown that the Wnt pathway is activated in 49% of HCC and that almost half of these had features consistent with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.6 These data are in line with an integrated analysis of somatic mutations which revealed activating mutations of β-catenin (CTNNB1) in 33% of human HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations of CTNNB1 are mutually exclusive with mutations in AXIN1.7 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are implicated in liver carcinogenesis.8–10 We and others have provided data to support the involvement of small ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, in the modulation of liver cell proliferation and apoptosis.10–13 Despite several studies linking ncRNA and the Wnt pathway, most of them focused on the modulation of Wnt signalling proteins by microRNAs, little is known about the effect of this pathway on ncRNA.14–17 Increasing evidence points to an important regulatory role of long ncRNAs in cellular processes and disease phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Sequence conservation across species has been postulated to indicate that a given ncRNA may have a cellular function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide survey identified 481 genomic sequences with a size &gt;200 bp that showed a remarkable conservation with 100% identity across human, mouse and rat genomes.18 These ultraconserved regions (UCR) were shown to be transcribed as ultraconserved ncRNAs (T-UCR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>They exhibit distinct profiles in various human cancers and modulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis.19–25 We have previously shown that T-UCRs are aberrantly expressed in HCC and have a role in the malignant growth of human and murine hepatocytes.25 In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of Wnt/β-catenin signalling on T-UCRs in order to find downstream effectors of this pathway that can be targeted for the development of novel and more specific therapeutics. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>It is becoming clear that a large number of lncRNAs have a determining role in regulating normal cell physiology as well as a variety of diseases including cancer.42 T-UCRs are long ncRNAs that harbour ultraconserved elements and are altered in human carcinomas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Despite some evidence suggests that DNA methylation and miRNA-mediated regulation may be responsible for their modulation,19 20 the mechanisms of T-UCR deregulation have been poorly explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In these studies, we showed that T-UCRs may act downstream of key signalling routes, such as the Wnt pathway, and drive cancer cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Wnt/β-catenin signalling is a key driver in about half of liver cancers, and growing evidence is suggesting that ncRNAs are mediators of this pathway.17 43 We provide the first evidence that T-UCRs can be dependent on Wnt activation in a species-conserved fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In addition, our studies showed that uc.158− is activated only in cancer cells, suggesting it may be specific for Wnt activation that should be targeted for an antitumoural effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Wnt inhibitor exploitation has been limited by toxicity, and activation of the Wnt pathway in cirrhotic liver may preclude the use of these drugs in patients with liver cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the identification of a cancer-specific mediator of the pathway may improve the potential of designing novel and more selective drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we have shown that molecular traits, such as overexpression of uc.158−, may be present across tumour types independently on site of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>These findings inform us that T-UCRs may either be used as tissue-specific biomarkers, as in the case of TUC338,25 or may be commonly deregulated across tumour types, such as uc.158−. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria with regard to tumour origin (ICC vs ECC) are still a debateable question in the design of clinical trials in CCA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>However, based on these studies, we may suggest that clinical trials should be designed on the bases of molecular and genomic features instead of tumour site, and may even include ICC and HCC for selective drugs that target commonly deregulated pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>As per the reason why uc.158− is aberrantly deregulated in malignant hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, we may speculate that uc.158− overexpressing hepatic cancer stem cells may give rise to specific subtypes of HCC and CCA in the presence of Wnt pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude that the plasticity of mature hepatocytes to differentiate in cholangiocytes may justify some common traits acquired during liver carcinogenesis.44 45 Another potential explanation relies on the evidence that stroma is an important Wnt activator even in tumours, such as CCA, that lack CTNNB1 mutations.27 35 Thus, further studies are warranted to explore the involvement of the stroma-induced activation of uc.158− driven carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of function of T-UCRs is still not clearly elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence suggests that they may act as decoy molecules for miRNAs.38 We provided data in support of this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that miR-193b mediates apoptosis through targeting of mcl-1,12 and the overexpression of uc.158− in HCC nicely fits with these data as well as with the previous work that found downregulation of miR-193b in a subgroup of HCCs.39 40 It is increasingly recognised that cancer cells rely on a complex network of transcripts generated from coding and non-coding genes, and that interplay of different RNA classes drives cancer progression more than a single aberration.46 However, identification of a single molecule representing the activation of a network may prove more useful for the identification of therapeutic targets and for the implementation of screening technologies to be adopted for targeted therapy. </plain></SENT>
