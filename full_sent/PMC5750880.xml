<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Arsenic is present in the form of inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic in ecological environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of arsenic is different according to the type, and inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic, of these, trivalent arsenite is more toxic than pentavalent arsenate [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inorganic arsenic is mainly derived from the environment, and organic arsenic is mainly consumed as food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the risk assessment, it is necessary to distinguish between inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Arsenic exposure via drinking water is a very important public health concern worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The severity of the health effects of arsenic in drinking water is constantly being reevaluated by various government agencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation [2] are representative skin symptoms that are the first to be manifested by chronic arsenic exposure and are also used as clinical indicators of arsenic exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been associated with respiratory, neurological, and diabetic mellitus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that chronic respiratory inflammation are caused by arsenic-induced respiratory diseases [3], and peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, and polyneuropathy are caused by nervous system diseases [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>An epidemiologic report on the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth in chronic exposure to arsenic during pregnancy [5], and the report of congenital anomalies [6] suggest that exposure to arsenic may cause reproductive and developmental abnormalities [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, various harmful health effects due to exposure to low concentrations of inorganic arsenic have been reported in many studies [8,9,10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In a recent epidemiological study, various health effects, including skin cancer, have been reported to be caused by exposure to low concentrations of arsenic (10 µg/L) via drinking water [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Some studies have also shown that well water samples containing arsenic concentrations of &gt;1.0 µg/L were associated with skin cancer [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, World Health Organization, and the Food and Drug Administration have all lowed the international cut off for total arsenic concentration in drinking water from 50 µg/L to 10 µg/L [14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this global trend, Korea has also decreased the cut off from 50 µg/L to 10 µg/L in the 2007 [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>All local governments under the Korean system are required to conduct water quality tests annually according to the law. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As a result of the water quality test, some area residents, including children, were found to have taken arsenic contaminated drinking water that exceeds the maximum allowable criteria (10 µg/L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, owing to poor knowledge of the toxicity of the arsenic, communities have excessive anxiety of arsenic toxicity health risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It has been raised the need of a health impact assessment and an epidemiological study by local residents and non-governmental organization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate arsenic species concentration and the health effects that are associated with short-term (within one year) arsenic exposure via contaminated drinking water. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim was to establish prevention strategies for arsenic related diseases by determining the route of arsenic exposure, and to disseminate relevant scientific information within communities that have expressed anxiety towards the health effects of arsenic exposure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The data obtained at the second screening stage showed a very similar trend: 16–97 µg/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This indicates that water containing arsenic concentrations above the standard value has been supplied as drinking water for a few hundred local residents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Based on the geographic characteristic of the studied area, we presume that the contaminated water has been supplied for a few years after the small-scale water supply system has been installed; however, we do not have sufficient data to confirm this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the local government installed a drinking water filter for arsenic soon after they recognized the water contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the concentration of arsenic related decreased to below 10 µg/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The current study was initiated &gt;2 months after the filter installation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Generally, arsenic toxicity is caused by the exposure to high levels of arsenic (&gt;100 µg/L), and has shown a significant association with skin cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, and non-carcinogenic effects [20,21,22,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The non-carcinogenic effect has been reported to include human effects that are caused by ingestion of inorganic arsenic, including mucous membrane stimulation and skin lesions, peripheral neurotoxicity, keratosis, neuromuscular abnormalities, and vascular abnormalities [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Brown et al. [25] suggested the lifetime risk of developing skin cancer was 1.3/1000 for males and 0.6/1000 for females per microgram of arsenic per day in Taiwan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the regression analysis showed that the cancer mortality rate (per 100,000) for bladder, kidney, lung, and liver cancer significantly increased per microgram increase in arsenic exposure via drinking water in a linear dose-response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Abernathy et al. [26] suggested the NOAEL 0.8 µg/kg/day, LOAEL 14 µg/kg/day using the Tseng et al. [27] and Tseng model [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In the United States of America (USA), the estimated lifetime risk of dying from cancer due to arsenic exposure via drinking water (1.6 L/day) was 1/1000 per 2.5 microgram of arsenic exposure per day [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility of disease is related to the amount of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>When considering the elevated arsenic concentrations, it may not be sufficient to cause detectable health effects in a period of less than one year, however, lifetime assessment should be conducted in future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>We presume that the elevated arsenic concentrations may not be sufficient to cause detectable health effects in a period of less than one year, however, human exposure of arsenic could occur via other chemical exposure pathways, including ingestion of contaminated residential soil, inhalation of soil dust, dermal contact to the residential soil [30], and ingestion of contaminated agricultural foods [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it will be necessary to assess the health effects of multiple exposures when considering these factors in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>One of the limitations of this study was that we did not select a child control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>It was difficult to obtain control children who met the conditions to living condition, age distribution, and time and budget constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Although the adult control group was not satisfied as a case-control in comparison with the children exposure group, it was used as a reference to compare the concentration of inorganic arsenic that was exposed to contaminated water. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Our community-based health survey showed that the urinary organic and inorganic arsenic concentrations among residents were significantly higher than those of control site residents; moreover, the consumption of contaminated drinking water was found to urinary arsenic concentration in residents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>When considering that the current study was initiated &gt;2 months after the installation of the filter by the local government, and that the half-life of inorganic arsenic in the body is approximately 2–4 days, the level of arsenic exposure among residents in the past was higher than that recorded in the present study [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have shown that exposure to low concentrations of arsenic could result in high blood pressure, obesity, high triglyceride, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, anemia, and bone damage [33,34,35,36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects arsenic exposure; however, we did not find any carcinogenic or obvious clinical abnormalities among exposure residents when compared with the control subjects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied the tumor marker test to evaluate the carcinogenicity of arsenic, although it is a nonspecific test for cancer screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We selected tumor marker liver, colon, pancreas, ovary, prostate, and lung that carcinogenicity may be associated with the inorganic arsenic exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>As a result of analysis, one subject who exceeded the reference value in Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was found, but there was no clinical relevance according to the exposure of arsenic through close examination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>All of the subjects were within normal range and there was no statistically significant difference between the exposure and control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In general, this clinical tumor marker test is more applicable to follow up cancer management than cancer screening. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>We also found that the consumption of arsenic contaminated groundwater could elevate urinary organic and inorganic arsenic concentrations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>We recommend immediate discontinuation of groundwater supply in this area for the safety of the residents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, urinary inorganic arsenic level was found to decrease dramatically overtime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This study has several limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>First, it was difficult to accurately compare arsenic exposure concentrations before and after the introduction of the arsenic filtration system, since this study was conducted after the arsenic filtration systems were installed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Second, we did not perform the urinary creatinine normalization of arsenic in the comparison between exposed and control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the findings of this survey are important for policy making in Korea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This is the first epidemiological survey of arsenic contamination of drinking water in Korea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this survey could bring about cooperation among community residents, non-governmental organization, and the local government without the support of government. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>We believe these findings could serve as important evidence for the management of exposure to arsenic-contaminated groundwater. </plain></SENT>
