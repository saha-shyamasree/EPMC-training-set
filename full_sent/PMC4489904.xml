</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>China is among the countries most severely affected by desertification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the early 1950’s, more than 70 severe sandstorms occurred which led to topsoil losses, affecting the north central plain and northwestern China and eventually encroaching on the living environment of local people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In order to deal with problems associated with desertification and sandstorms, many ecological engineering projects have been established to minimize the impacts of desertification [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Hedysarum scoparium (Fisch. &amp; C.A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>May) (H. scoparium) is a vivacious leguminous and deciduous shrub growing in arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The shrub can reach a height of 0.8–3.0 m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The extensive root system of the large shrub can spread to 10 m horizontally and penetrate soil to 5–8 m depth (15 m in some cases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The extensive root system allows H. scoparium to survive on sandy desert soils (water content below 3%) and tolerate extremely high temperatures (from 50–60°C) and dry climates (&lt; 200 mm annual precipitation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Due to its high tolerance to drought and extreme temperatures, H. scoparium is an ideal xerophyte shrub for resisting desertification, and preventing soil, wind, and water erosion by providing sand dune stabilization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In 1956 the Hedysarum scoparium shrub was used to establish a vegetation belt along rail lines from Lanzhou to Baotou, which runs along the edge of the Tengger Desert [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Designed purpose for the vegetation belt was to stabilize migrating desert dunes in the Shapotou area at the Tengger Desert southeastern edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This project is viewed as a successful model for desertification control and ecological restoration along the railway infrastructure in the arid desert region in China. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Restoration of desert ecosystems using xerophyte shrubs produces a wide range of hydrological effects [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>There are more apparent in semiarid regions due to the large temporal and spatial variability in precipitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, our understanding of the water relations and physiological responses to environmental factors of these desert-living shrubs is limited, and a better understanding of transpiration by desert plants is urgently required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>At this time, few studies have been conducted to quantify the diurnal and seasonal transpiration of H. scoparium under natural conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In recent years, various methods using dyes, radioisotope, tracers, lysimeters, a heat balance and thermal diffusion have been used to measure plant transpiration [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, many of these measurement techniques are invasive and may damage the plant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The stem heat balance technique has been widely used for transpiration studies because it maintains the basic conditions of normal tree growth allows continuous monitoring over a period of time, is relatively easy, does not induce any modification of the environment, and is non-destructive to the shrub [3–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Many studies have used the stem heat balance method to measure the fluid-flow characteristics of various plants [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Moreover, shrubs with low stem porosity such as H. scoparium, are suitable for the application of the stem heat balance technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we used the method in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Eco-hydrological studies of transpiration indicate that plants regulate sap flow (J s) by adjusting stomatal conductance in response to changes in environmental variables, such as radiation intensity, soil moisture, rainfall, air temperature (T a), and wind speed (W s) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have focused mainly on the effect of individual environmental factors on plant physiology [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, the interaction of exterior environmental factors should not be neglected, as a certain combination of environmental factors likely play a role in determining plant respiration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For example, semiarid regions of northwestern China are characterized by summers with long water deficit periods and high solar radiation (R n); T a, and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>These variables are correlated with each other, potentially with a compensation effect that influences plant growth under adverse environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Plants may have acquired certain genetic characteristics enabling them to dynamically respond to different combinations of environmental factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As a dominant native species, H. scoparium has adapted to survive in a variety of harsh environmental conditions by adjusting its transpiration [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The measurement of J s can provide an accurate estimation of actual plant water consumption, but is often influenced by environmental factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>As a result, accurately estimating the sap flow rate and exploiting its relationships with various environmental factors or their interactions is important not only for physiological research but also for the appropriate management of this plant to combat desertification in arid regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study are to i) determine the diurnal and seasonal sap flow dynamics; ii) analyze the characteristics of daytime and nighttime sap flow and their environment dependence by using regression and redundancy analysis (RDA) methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Our results will provide the useful information for supporting the management of this ecologically important shrub in semiarid Northwestern China. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Model SGB25, SGB16, SGB13, and SGB9 gauges (Flow32 meters, Dynamax Inc., Houston, TX, USA) were mounted at the stems of 17 year old H. scoparium plants during the period from 1st May to 15th October, 2011 (due to the changing trend of the leave area index (LAI) we measured after DOY 290, but found the sap flow rate was very low, and had almost stopped). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Each sensor was installed on stem of different individual plants (S2 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Data was recorded at 10 second intervals and stored as 15 minute averages using a CR1000 data logger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Unlike other methods, Dynagages require no calibration since sap flow is directly determined by the energy balance and rates of heat convection by the sap flux (see more details at ftp://ftp.dynamax.com/Manuals/Dynagage_Manual.pdf). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>For stem heat balance technique will continue to give off heat to plant stem for a continuous time, its sensors are not affected by external interferences as the most common sensor types (like Trunk Heat Balance THB, Thermal Dissipation TD, Heat field deformation HFD) do. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>And it is different from other sap flow systems, which can get "net" sap flow data, from subtract the baseline representing the "fictitious flow" due to heat loses from the heated space. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Measurements of J s have been widely used to study plant responses to environmental factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>In our experiment, the diurnal stem J s of H. scoparium varied regularly and displayed consistent patterns of day and night cycles in plants with different stem diameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>In semi-arid regions, because of the large daily transpiration, tree roots passively absorb water, resulting in a large J s with a bimodal or multimodal curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>This behavior is universal among similar desert plant species, such as Haloxylon ammodendron [18], Salix gordejevii [19], Caragana microphylla [15], Nitraria sphaerocarpa and Elaeagnus angustifolia [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>During nighttime, J s still occurs and becomes constant to alleviate water stress and achieve a water balance in the plant body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>In this study, the nocturnal J s was very stable than the daytime J s and reveals that there were minor turbulence changes in nighttime environmental variables with the J s responding to atmospheric drivers [20–23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>It is commonly assumed that transpiration does not occur at night because leaf stomata are closed in the absence of light [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>However, there is considerable evidence that the stomata of some species do not close completely during the night which allows for transpiration in the presence of sufficient environmental driving forces [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that the nighttime J s of H. scoparium was substantial and varied according to the time of year and at different times of the night. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>Nighttime J s was correlated with the daytime J s of the previous day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the results of Snyder’s study which revealed that higher nighttime stomatal conductance and transpiration associated with higher daytime values across species and habitats, implying that quite an amount of nighttime J s was used to refill the stem water deficit as a result of high water loss during previous daytime [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>Leaf gas exchange and stem heat balance measurements were conducted in order to investigate the partition of nighttime J s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>It was found that the E L was only 1.67% of the SF n (see Fig 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the nighttime J s we observed was mainly used for refilling water in the trunk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>Same to our results, nocturnal J s was found to be primarily a function of refilling of stem storage rather than transpiration from the canopy with canopy transpiration accounting for 2.6–8.5% of nocturnal flows in Acacia mangium in the hilly lands of subtropical South China [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>Plant size is often the major parameter determining the water storage capacity [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>During our studies, the nighttime water recharge of H. scoparium was strongly dependent on stem diameter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>Our estimates of the contribution of nighttime water recharge to the total transpiration ranged from 19.59 to 48.7% depending on the stem diameter of the plant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>The contribution of nighttime stem water recharge in H. scoparium was higher in summer than other seasons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>During the entire experimental period, the total sap flow rates of H. scoparium were 1045.4 (25 mm), 397.7 (16 mm), 311.1 (13 mm) and 159.7 L (9 mm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>Sap flow rates increased from May to August, and then decreased from September to October due to changes in the local natural environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>There was a significant exponential relationship between J s and the ET 0 on a daily time scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="501" pm="."><plain>On an hourly time scale, the relationship was influenced by P [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>Usually, a small amount of P would increase the J s and the ET 0, but when the P was large, the J s and the ET 0 decreased sharply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>The reason for this was that a small amount of rainfall would increase the leaf water potential and leaf conductance to the water VPD, gas exchange and photosynthesis, but when the rainfall was large, the R n, T a, and VPD would decline over a long period (see Figs 2 and 3), and hence the J s and ET 0 decreased [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>In the experimental period, 25 individual rainfall events were observed, with over 70% occurring in summer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>The rainfall occurred as strong and short-term events, and afterwards long-term drought stress occurred on the soil surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our research, J s data during rainy days was not used in the correlation analysis because the duration and amount of P were crucial for determining the J s values, which was dependent on the resulting variations in meteorological factors, SWC and soil water limitations can cause a decreased J s and high evaporative demand may result in data errors and inaccuracy [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>SWC in the 0–100 cm layer, with P mainly accumulated at this infiltration depth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>In the previous studies, the relationship between the SWC and J s was shown to be complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="509" pm="."><plain>Xia et al. (2008) reported that SWC had no direct relationship with the daily J s [11], but contrary results have also been reported [27–29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="510" pm="."><plain>In our study, no obvious evidence of strong close correlations between J s and the shallow SWC levels (0–100 cm) was found, but the close relationship between J s and the ET 0, indicated that the transpiration rate of H. scoparium was more responsive to the changes of ET 0. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="511" pm="."><plain>In northwestern China, regional climate change is likely to increase the variability in P patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="512" pm="."><plain>Consequently, desert shrubs will be forced to endure repetitive cycles of water scarcity followed by uneven rainfall. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="513" pm="."><plain>As a high water consumption plant, in H. scoparium, natural rainfall in the shallow soil layer is not fully utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that H. scoparium may consume underground water (in the region the typical underground water depth is below 15 m) to maintain growth and drought resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>In some locations, H. scoparium may have a negative impact on the water equilibrium due to its deep root system and potential water consuming capacity, which requires further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>The variation of J s in tree species was related not only to their biological and physiological characteristics, such as canopy structure, stomatal closure and root hydraulic conductance, but also to environmental factors [9, 27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>In the whole growing season due to rapidly changing weather, there were many outliers data points in the J s data values which were very sporadic, jumpy and inconsistent, most of which were observed in the 25 mm stem diameter plant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>Indicate that larger plant was more sensitive to climatic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>Because of its broad transpiration leaf area, the stem diameter of 25 mm plant had the largest flow rate and a great fluctuating variation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>In our study, J s varied under different weather, agreeing with a Giorio and Giorio (2003) who reported that the magnitude of J s for olive trees during sunny days was greater than during rainy days due to low T a, low R n and a low VPD [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="521" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were also found in Larix decidua [31], Eucalyptus grandis [32, 33], Ligustrum japonicum [34] and Tamarix elongata [28] that low J s can be caused by low VPD in windy weather; increasing intensity of R n and increasing T a on sunny days induce stomatal opening in a certain time, thereby accelerating J s. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="522" pm="."><plain>RDA and Kendall’s tau values suggested that daily J s of plants was correlated positively with R n, T a, and W s, and negatively with RH (p &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="523" pm="."><plain>The daily J s (25 mm) in H. scoparium was found to be a function of six environmental factors (T a, VPD, W s, RH, soil temperature at 30 cm, and SoilG) but all varied throughout the year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="524" pm="."><plain>The same methods were applied in Juglans regia L [28], Malus domestica Borkh [35], Caragana korshinskii [11], Caragana microphylla [12] and Populus euphratica [24], and it was found that T a, VPD, and RH were the three major factors affecting sap flow rate on clear days, but the role of the three factors varied according to the growth stages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="525" pm="."><plain>It has previously been suggested that environmental factors, such as T a and VPD, significantly affect nighttime J s [22, 24, 26, 33, 36–41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="526" pm="."><plain>The significant correlation between some environmental factors and the nighttime J s of H. scoparium observed in this study supports this assertion (see Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="527" pm="."><plain>In addition, the nighttime J s was more affected by tree features, especially in the plants with a smaller diameter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="528" pm="."><plain>The nocturnal J s of small plants corresponded to T a and VPD at the study site, which can be approximated by a non-linear relationship based on the minimum threshold for nighttime J s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="529" pm="."><plain>The obtained minimum threshold of VPD driving force was consistent with results reported by Moore GW (2008) and Sellin A (2010) [42–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="530" pm="."><plain>Both researchers suggested nighttime sap flow was elevated under relatively high T a and VPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="531" pm="."><plain>There studies were carried out on Tamarix elongata, and Juniperus scopulorum in the semiarid regions where optimal VPD values reached 1.5 KPa and 2.5 KPa, respectively. </plain></SENT>
