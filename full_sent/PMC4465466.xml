</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Ammonia detoxification is an essential bodily function required for nitrogen homeostasis and physiological well-being [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Ammonia molecules are produced mainly through catabolism of amino acid and other nitrogenous metabolites in tissues, and also via amino acid deamination and urea salvage by gut bacteria [1, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Whereas a small portion of ammonia is removed via direct renal excretion, the urea cycle in the liver plays a predominant role in ammonia disposal, converting ammonia to the relatively harmless urea for excretion [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The urea cycle consists of five enzymatic reactions sequentially taking place in the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) catalyzes the first reaction wherein ammonia and bicarbonate combine to form carbamoyl phosphate, and mice deficient in Cps1 suffered pronounced hyperammonemia and neonatal lethality [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As a strikingly abundant protein comprising as much as 20 % of total mitochondrial matrix protein mass [10], CPS1 is also subjected to diverse molecular and cellular regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Besides the classically known allosteric activator N-acetylglutamate (NAG), CPS1 level and activity are also regulated by complex molecular and physiological mechanisms [7, 11–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coordinate induction of urea cycle components has also been reported at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [7, 17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>An emerging cellular mechanism for nitrogen homeostasis is our intrinsic biological timer, the circadian clock [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In mammals, core clock genes form interlocked feedback loops, driving gene expression to regulate various metabolic pathways [20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Several earlier studies have implicated a role of the clock in protein or nitrogen metabolism [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>More recently, it was shown that the transcription factor Klf15 is encoded by a clock-controlled gene, and that Klf15 maintains nitrogen balance via regulation of the second urea cycle gene Otc [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genomic and proteomic studies have also demonstrated circadian variation of Cps1 mRNA and protein expression in mouse liver, although discrepancies remain concerning mRNA oscillation and protein peaks [26–29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Apart from the clock being an intrinsic regulator, diet is an external factor that profoundly influences nitrogen homeostasis and ammonia metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Dietary management for genetic hyperammonemia, mainly including protein restriction and supplementation of urea cycle substrate, serves to attenuate ammonia generation and/or bolster ammonia disposal [3, 30–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, dietary challenges also strongly influence ammonia metabolism and detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For example, the ureagenic capacity of the urea cycle, while far exceeding demand under normal conditions [14], has been shown to be up-regulated in response to greater metabolic challenge [7, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, ammonia control under varying diet conditions is not well characterized, and little is known regarding functional dietary components for ammonia control besides metabolic substrates [30, 34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Here, we report novel ammonia-lowering activities and clock-dependent mechanism for urea cycle regulation of a natural polyphenolic flavonoid, Nobiletin (NOB). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Among a growing number of bioactive polyphenols, Nobiletin (NOB) is a citrus-derived dietary flavonoid with diverse physiological functions [40–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>More recently, NOB has been shown to display a protective role against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and other metabolic dysfunctions [44–46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>To investigate a potential role of NOB in nitrogen homeostasis, we examined serum ammonium levels in wild-type (WT) mice under different diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Under RC, NOB did not significantly affect body weight (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous findings [44, 45], NOB ameliorated body weight gain under HFD (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Importantly however, under both diets, NOB markedly reduced serum ammonium levels (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>At Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 6 corresponding to mid-day (inactive phase), NOB led to a more pronounced reduction for HFD than RC (27.5 % vs 14.4 %) (Fig. 1b, left). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Ammonia-lowering activities of NOB were also observed at ZT18 corresponding to mid-night when mice were active (Fig. 1b, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Whereas attenuated serum ammonia levels were observed in HFD.Veh than RC.Veh, likely due to lower protein content in HFD than RC (20 % vs. 29 % in calories), NOB treatment diminished the ammonia levels in both diets by similar degrees.Fig. 1Nobiletin (NOB) lowers serum ammonia levels. a Body weight change of wild-type (WT) mice fed with regular chow (RC) or high-fat diet (HFD) and treated with either vehicle (Veh) or Nobiletin (NOB) for 10 weeks (n = 11–12). ***p &lt; 0.001. b Serum ammonia levels at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 6 and 18 in the mice described in (a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Importantly, during the active phase at ZT18 when serum ammonia levels were significantly elevated in HPD, NOB robustly reduced serum ammonia to RC levels (Fig. 1d, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicated a broad role of NOB in reducing serum ammonia content at both active and inactive circadian phases under RC, HFD and HPD conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NOB more strongly reduced serum ammonia levels under HFD and HPD at ZT6 and ZT18 respectively, serving to normalize the exaggerated circadian variation between active and inactive phases in these diets compared with RC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrated a broad effect of the natural flavonoid NOB in reducing serum ammonia levels under varying diet conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>NOB and other related polymethoxylated flavonoids are dietary components generally showing favorable pharmacokinetic profiles [61, 62], and mouse and human studies revealed promising efficacy of NOB against the metabolic syndrome without significant toxicity [40, 44, 45, 63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The current work illustrated a novel function of NOB in ammonia disposal, extending the long list of physiological benefits associated with NOB and other natural flavonoids [63, 64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In light of these beneficial attributes, it warrants further investigation whether NOB can be incorporated into dietary management for congenital and injury-induced hyperammonemia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed broad ammonia-lowering activities of NOB in mice fed with RC, HFD or HPD, ostensibly utilizing distinct, diet-specific mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Whereas transcriptional activation of CPS1 via C/EBP induction seems to operate under HFD, NOB treatment in conjunction with RC and HPD feeding appeared not to elicit significant CPS1 induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in contrast to RC where NOB similarly reduced serum ammonia at both ZT6 and ZT18, in HFD and HPD NOB more strongly diminished the relative high ammonia levels in respective diets (ZT6 for HFD and ZT18 for HPD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>As a result, NOB functions to reverse the exaggerated ammonia variation between the active and inactive phases, essentially normalizing circadian ammonia rhythm in HFD and HPD to RC levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Given the remarkably diverse cellular pathways known to be modulated by NOB and other flavonoids, various molecular and cellular mechanisms may underlie such mechanistic and functional plasticity [63–67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Besides transcriptional regulation (C/EBP, glucocorticoid receptor, CREB and HNF3) and the allosteric cofactor NAG [7, 17], recent mechanistic studies have also underscored the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) for CPS1 protein activity [11–13, 47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Other urea cycle genes may also serve as the primary target; one such candidate is Otc, especially given its functional connection with the circadian clock [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Finally, NOB may also attenuate HPD-induced bacterial production of ammonia by amino acid deamination and urea hydrolysis [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed differential responses of serum and urine urea levels to NOB treatment in HFD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Urea represents the most predominant circulating nitrogen reservoir, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is known to be regulated by multiple factors including protein intake, protein metabolism and renal function [1, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>HFD contains lower protein content than RC (20 % vs. 29 % in calories), and NOB acts to attenuate ammonia levels by activating urea cycle gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Thus, urea may be salvaged to maintain nitrogen balance in the HFD.NOB condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>For example, urine excretion rate/volume and renal reabsorption of water/mineral/urea are tightly coupled to regulate osmotic pressure, which may in turn modulate serum and urine urea levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>However, a direct role of NOB in renal function remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Amino acid levels in human blood have been shown to exhibit robust circadian oscillation, concordant with results from a yeast metabolic cycle resembling mammalian circadian rhythm [68–70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In parallel with fluctuating amino acid levels over the daily cycle, CPS1 and several other urea cycle components exhibited circadian mRNA and protein expression patterns [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, much conflictory evidence has also been reported with regard to Cps1 circadian expression [26, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Our experiments, using specific primers and antibodies, revealed weak oscillation of Cps1 mRNA and protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, NOB appeared to augment CPS1 protein oscillation under RC, and also enhanced CPS1 levels under HFD in a circadian clock-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism of circadian regulation may depend on C/EBPs as their expression is subjected to clock control [50], although other mechanisms likely exist [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Of note, we observed distinct circadian changes of C/EBPα p42 and p30 isoforms in ClockΔ19/Δ19 mutant mice relative to WT, suggesting a possible circadian regulation of alternative translation. </plain></SENT>
