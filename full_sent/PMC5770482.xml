</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 90% of all kidney cancers [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While the prognosis of patients with localised disease treated with surgery is relatively good, the prognosis of patients with advanced or metastatic disease is poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) ranges from 7.8 months for patients with a poor risk to 43.2 months for patients with a favourable risk according to the Heng criteria [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Besides the impact of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) on survival, mRCC can be associated with severe symptoms, such as cachexia and/or anorexia, asthenia and/or fatigue, pain, anaemia, and venous thromboembolism [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Since 2006, several new targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of mRCC such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and everolimus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In phase III studies, these therapies improved progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with mRCC over the diverse comparators [4â11], but the effect on OS was less pronounced, likely (partly) due to treatment crossover. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that one of the benefits of the new therapies is a delay in HRQoL deterioration as a result of a delay in progression of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Clinicians feel that a better PFS translates into a better HRQoL [12], but little data are available supporting this relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the context of the high prices of targeted therapies which form a strain on health care budgets, it is important to establish whether indeed a delay in progression delays HRQoL deterioration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to provide insight into the most important determinants of HRQoL (including progression of disease) of patients with mRCC using data from a patient registry in the Netherlands [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this study aims to assess if the association between progression and HRQoL, if one exists, is also captured by measures used in economic evaluations to assess benefit (i.e. EQ-5D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Patients with RCC (all stages) of any histological subtype diagnosed from 2011 until June 30th 2013 in 25 of 32 hospitals (both general and academic) in three regions in the Netherlands were invited to participate, and fill out HRQoL questionnaires. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were identified through the hospitalsâ registration systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR), which maintains a cancer registration database of all cancer patients in the Netherlands, was used to ensure that no patients were missed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The research protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen (CMO Region Arnhem-Nijmegen) in May 2010. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Cancer-specific HRQoL was measured using the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (v3.0) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This measure includes five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea &amp; vomiting and pain), a global health status/QOL scale and six single items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition to the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EQ-5D-5L was used to measure HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D-5L is a preference-based generic measure, and measures HRQoL on five dimensions, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Each dimension includes five severity levels [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Patients were sent a HRQoL questionnaire every 3 months in the first year of participation in the study, and every 6 months in the second year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Participation started as soon as possible following a diagnosis of (m)RCC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In addition to data on HRQoL, data on demographics, clinical and laboratory factors (to determine the patientâs risk group [16]) were collected retrospectively from individual patient records using uniform case report forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, data on treatment schemes and treatment endpoints (e.g. survival) were derived from patient records. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Data collection stopped at the end of 2013. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>For each scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30, the average of the items that contributed to that scale was calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>They were then linearly transformed in line with the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>EQ-5D utilities were derived by combining the answers to the EQ-5D-5L with the Dutch EQ-5D- 5L tariff [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Mean EQ-5D utilities and HRQoL based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 were calculated by taking the average of the observations for each patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The proportion of reported problems for each EQ-5D dimension were presented by taking the modus (i.e. the level reported most frequently) across observations for each patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>If two or more modes exist, the highest level was taken. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>HRQoL was evaluated separately for the periods before and after progression of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In the period before progression of disease, a further distinction was made between wait-and-see and treatment with (first-line) targeted therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Treatment was assumed to last until progression of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Response including progression of disease was defined based on RECIST (as mentioned in the radiology report). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>As a substitute (if unavailable) data managers were instructed to register the response as indicated by the physician in the medical record. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not start therapy within the follow-up period were assumed to wait for therapy during the entire follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Since data on HRQoL were clustered, random effects models [19] were used to study associations between HRQoL (i.e. EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status and EQ-5D utility) and patient and disease characteristics, symptoms and treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Use of random effects models ensured that multiple measurements from the same patient were analysed appropriately and made it possible to distinguish between intraindividual and interindividual variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Backward selection was used to select the covariates for the models; any non-significant covariates were excluded from the models one at a time (significance level of 0.20 for entering and 0.10 for removing the explanatory variables). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To control for heteroscedasticity, random effects models with robust standard errors were estimated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Additionally, random effects logit models [19] were used to study associations between the individual EQ-5D dimensions and patient and disease characteristics, symptoms and treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>EQ-5D levels were dichotomised into âno problems/(i.e. level 1) and âproblemsâ (i.e. levels 2â5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Missing data regarding patient and disease characteristics were handled using multiple imputations by chained equations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>In this study differences were found between the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) before and after progression of disease, with a reduced HRQoL after progression of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Progression of disease was no longer associated with a deterioration of HRQoL in multivariable analyses after correction for symptoms (at a significance level of 0.05 and 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In line with Wilson and Cleary [21], a relationship between disease characteristics and symptoms was expected, which could explain why disease characteristics (such as progression) were no longer statistically significant in the multivariable analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Similarly, bone metastases were no longer associated with a deterioration of HRQoL in multivariable analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Since bone metastases can cause pain, then it is not surprising that bone metastases are not significantly associated with HRQoL once pain is included in the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>This seems to imply that symptoms increase due to progression of disease (and/or due to the spread of the cancer to the bone), which explains the reduced HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Besides the relationship between symptoms and HRQoL, a significant association was found between radiotherapy and HRQoL (in the model with the EQ-5D utility as the dependent variable). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>It is possible that this observed association is not due to radiotherapy itself, but to the selection of which mRCC patients are to receive radiotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>That is, radiotherapy is mostly reserved for palliation of local and symptomatic disease or to prevent the progression of metastatic disease in critical sites (i.e. bones and brain) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Either way, radiotherapy appears to be a significant determinant of HRQoL, even after correction for patient and disease characteristics (including bone and brain metastases) and symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The average EQ-5D utility of patients with mRCC was 0.74 compared to an average of 0.84 (SD, 0.18) in the Dutch population aged 60 to 69 [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Most patients (74%) in the study population were treated with a targeted therapy (the majority received sunitinib). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The average EQ-5D utility of these patients was 0.76 before progression of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In a study by Cella et al., a similar EQ-5D utility was reported for patients treated with sunitinib (i.e. 0.75) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In the economic evaluation of bevacizumab and sunitinib by Thompson-Coon and colleagues [24], a health state utility of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76â0.80) was used for progression-free survival and 0.70 (95% CI 0.66â0.74) for progressive disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These utilities were derived from the data presented in the sunitinib submission to NICE and are somewhat higher than the utilities that we found in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The economic evaluation of sunitinib by RemÃ¡k and colleagues [25] was based on the results of a phase II trial of sunitinib as second-line treatment in mRCC [26]; utilities of 0.72 and 0.76 were used for progression-free survival (i.e. during treatment or rest, respectively), whereas utilities of 0.63 and 0.55 were used for progressive disease (i.e. during second-line treatment or after termination of second-line treatment, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The latter utilities are below the utilities found in our study, but this might be explained by differences in the study population, e.g. patients with progression on first-line cytokine therapy were enrolled in the phase II trial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This study has several limitations that deserve mentioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>First, only 9% of the population (including those patients with RCC but not having metastatic disease) completed the 2-year follow-up period and filled in seven questionnaires. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This is mainly because data collection stopped before many patients could be followed up for 2 years after diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>That is, data collection stopped at the end of 2013, which meant that patients diagnosed after January 1st 2012 were not able to complete the full follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>There are no reasons to expect important differences between the patients who did and did not complete the 2-year follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Second, a significant association between WHO performance status and HRQoL, and the MSKCC risk score and HRQoL was not found, although such a relationship would have been expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The MSKCC risk score divides patients into three risk groups, and gives an indication of the life expectancy of patients with mRCC [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Whereas HRQoL was measured several times during the follow-up period, data on patient characteristics (e.g. WHO performance status) and disease characteristics (e.g. laboratory factors, which are part of the MSKCC risk score) were collected once before the start of each new treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, too few observations on patient and disease characteristics might have been available to detect a significant association between WHO performance status and the MSKCC risk score, and HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a significant association between comorbidities and HRQOL might have been expected, but data on comorbidities were only collected once (at diagnosis) which might explain why a significant association was not found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the impact of comorbidities on HRQoL might be captured to some extent through age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Age appeared not to be significantly associated with HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>A third limitation is that our study sample was too small to find any difference in EQ-5D utilities between different types of targeted therapies, while these therapies differ in toxicity profiles [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, although adverse events have a high impact on HRQoL, an association between adverse events and HRQoL would not be found if the proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 adverse events is relatively low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Hypertension and fatigue are the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the randomised phase 3 trial of sunitinib [4], but these adverse events occurred in only 8 and 7% of the population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a very large sample size is needed to find any difference in EQ-5D utilities between different types of targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it is unknown whether the improved HRQoL due to prolonged PFS outweighs reductions in HRQoL due to treatment-related adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this study did not find differences in HRQoL of patients treated with systemic therapy and patients not treated with systemic therapy, or between periods with or without systemic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, this study may have been underpowered to find such differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>A fourth limitation is that no data were collected in the PERCEPTION-registry on assistance provided to patients who reported problems on one or more of the functioning scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, while these patients could have received assistance to relieve their complaints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>For example, patients could have received care at home to help with dressing and washing or emotional support by a psychologist or another healthcare professional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the impact of mRCC on HRQoL as presented in TableÂ 2 might be underestimated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the total number of patients with mRCC was 233 in the 2011â2013 Cohort of the PERCEPTION-registry [13], while only 87 patients filled in one or more questionnaires about HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the patient and disease characteristics and outcomes (in terms of overall survival) showed that the patients in the current study had a more favourable prognosis than the other patients in the PERCEPTION-registry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The impact on HRQoL as we estimated in this study is expected to be small, since we presented HRQoL associated with different stages of the disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>To conclude, key drivers for reduced HRQoL in mRCC are symptoms of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Since this study showed that symptoms increase with progression of disease, targeted therapies that increase PFS can help to delay loss in HRQoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This study also showed that the EQ-5D is able to detect changes in HRQoL of patients with mRCC, as it found associations between well-known symptoms of mRCC and EQ-5D utilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were found between these symptoms and the disease-specific EORTC QLQ-C30. </plain></SENT>
