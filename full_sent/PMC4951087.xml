</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As one of the most important meat production animals worldwide, sheep have always held an important position in animal husbandry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, enhancing the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of muscle growth in sheep and identifying genes that regulate the growth of skeletal muscle are of great significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, compared to the more comprehensively studied human [1], mouse [2], maize [3] and cow [4] transcriptomes, sheep transcriptomic research remains at a low level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Recently, with the development of whole-transcriptome sequencing, several studies have been undertaken to research the regulation in various specific sheep tissues in diverse researches [5–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge, most of these high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies have neglected to explore the unannotated transcripts in sheep. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>RNAseq makes it possible to reveal the expression profiles underlying phenotype, metabolic and physiological changes and different stages of development and environmental impacts at single-base resolution [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Another important capacity of RNAseq is the revelation of unannotated transcriptional activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>By identifying massive novel transcripts, we can find new gene loci (protein coding and noncoding) and can complement the structure of the known genes [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, to obtain an accurate map of annotated transcripts together with their expression in sheep skeletal muscle, high-throughput sequencing was applied to construct two cDNA libraries from the biceps brachii of small-tailed Han (SH) sheep and Dorper (DP) sheep, and whole-transcriptome analysis was performed to describe the comprehensive transcript catalogue of this tissue [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Dorper sheep are a South Africa breed with good muscle conformation to produce a desirable carcass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>They have a flat back and wide waist, and their legs are short and thin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>While the small-tailed Han sheep, with long, strong limbs and an elliptical fanshaped tail, are indigenous breed in China that provide good flavored meat and are rich in fat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Dorper sheep are famous as a meat-producing breed for their rapid muscle growth, while small-tailed Han sheep have a higher mean litter size (2.61) [17] than Dorper sheep (1.45 to 1.60) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The results of our previous study were analyzed to report differentially expressed genes, alternative splicing, coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) and new transcription units [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, the dataset of unannotated new transcripts still lacks accurate identification and annotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recent updates to the sheep genome and gene annotation have reduced the reference value of the results of the original new transcript analysis, which not only led to wasted data but also hindered the in-depth understanding of the regulation of skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we decided to reanalyze the sequencing data to find new transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The functions of these transcripts are largely unknown, although there is increasing evidence that new transcripts play key roles across diverse biological processes, with an emerging theme of interfacing with epigenetic regulatory pathways [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thus, the sheer number and increasing pace of discovery of new transcripts are accompanied by the growing challenge of their definition and annotation [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We believe that these newly identified transcripts lacking annotation information in the reference sheep genome might play important roles in the complex regulatory processes of sheep skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this study, to describe the comprehensive transcript catalogue of sheep skeletal muscle, we focused on the identification of new transcripts expressed in this tissue, including protein-coding RNA and non-coding RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Using RNAseq and bioinformatics analyses, a group of new transcripts was identified and underwent detailed classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This study of new transcripts will provide important information concerning the sheep genome and transcriptome annotation and will provide a basis for our future work on sheep skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Moreover, due to the frequent updates of the sheep reference genome and gene annotation data, our past results have been unable to serve as a reference for further research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we decided to reanalyze the sequencing data based on the latest genome annotation to reveal the new transcripts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Consistently with transcriptome-wide studies in other species [2,3,4,37], the results of our research have also revealed a large number of new transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, 40,129 unique primary muscle transcripts were assigned to the sheep genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3,467 transcripts (8.64%) were not annotated in the reference sheep genome, a slightly lower proportion than in our previous report [15,16] and in similar research on sheep skin [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This result is believed to be due to the continuous improvement of the genome information, the complementarity of known gene structure and the annotation of new gene loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In addition, the new transcripts were distributed evenly among the chromosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>These distribution characteristics indicate that the new transcripts are not a product of transcriptional noise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Of the 3,467 new transcripts, a total of 246 have been clearly identified by comparative sequence analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Such results could be an effective supplement to reference genome annotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that among the 246 identified transcripts, 11 protein-coding transcripts were determined to be unknown proteins because they did not match up with any functional annotated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that there are still many proteins of unknown function that play roles in skeletal muscle growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The functions of these unknown proteins require further study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Our analysis identified a number of reliable potential lncRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This dataset of 1,520 lncRNAs should be useful for sheep skeletal muscle regulation research or in the study of possible functional differences among sheep varieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, using the same method as Li and Eichten [3], we found no transcripts containing homologous sequences to miRNAs, even though miRNA precursors should be important components of putative lncRNAs [7,34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>This result might be due to the poor annotation level of sheep miRNA compared to other species, such as human and cow; that is, the total number of annotated sheep miRNAs (153) supported by miRBase is far less than the numbers in human (2,588) and cow (793). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Using the same method as described above, a small amount of acceptable alignment results were detected during the comparison with human (18 hits) and cow (60 hits), which could be an evidence for our hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This result also means that a group of small RNA precursors should be included in our dataset of high confidence lncRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Compared to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are more likely to show interspecific specificity [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The recognition of lncRNAs with specific expression characteristics should be useful to help explain the regulation of gene expression and to improve the reference genome annotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, no transcriptome-wide lncRNA recognition had previously been executed in sheep skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Supported by EST data on several species, 334 lncRNA transcripts were specifically expressed in ruminants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Moreover, among them, 3 lncRNA transcripts were found to be specifically expressed in sheep skeletal muscle, which indicates they might play important roles in the regulatory processes of sheep skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Further research will be performed to confirm the specific functions of these transcripts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>A total of 2199 new transcripts were identified as differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1115 were eventually got the classification results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Compared to our previous report [16], these transcripts revealed the unknown portion of the difference between the two transcriptome, which greatly improved our understanding of the sheep skeletal muscle transcriptome complexity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>However, only 90 of them received comparative sequence analysis result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>As for the other 1025 differentially expressed transcripts which were classified as high-confidence lncRNA, it is still unable to confirm their physiological function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>To identify the small RNA precursors and competitive endogenous RNA from high-confidence lncRNA, a sufficient credible sheep small RNA dataset should be greatly helpful, and this should also be the focus of our future research. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In this study, a catalogue of new transcripts for sheep skeletal muscle was generated based on a whole-transcriptome RNAseq approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>A complex transcript pattern in sheep skeletal muscle, including protein-coding and non-coding RNA, was verified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,467 transcripts were not annotated in the reference sheep genome and were defined as new transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>A total of 246 new transcripts were classified as portions of unannotated or incompletely annotated genes, and 1,520 transcripts were predicted with high confidence to be lncRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our analysis revealed 334 new lncRNA transcripts that displayed specific expression in ruminants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The expression of 20 selected new transcripts was confirmed in several sheep tissues by RT-PCR, 3 lncRNA transcripts without intergenus homology but with specific expression in sheep skeletal muscle were also been discovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that new transcripts without annotations still occupied a considerable proportion of the sheep transcriptome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>These novel transcripts should not be ignored in transcriptome and genomic studies, as they might play important roles in regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results complement the current sheep reference genome annotation and constitute a valuable resource for the identification of new transcripts underlying the muscle growth of sheep, which might aid future studies. </plain></SENT>
