<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 7–12% of the total cases and it is still increasing by approximately 3% each year globally, particularly among children1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term complications due to diabetes are a major cause of disability, reduced quality of life and premature death2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5.0 million people aged between 20 and 79 years died from diabetes in 2015, which accounts for 14.5% of global all-cause mortality among people in this age group1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This risk excess seems to be essentially driven by kidney disease3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is detected clinically by screening for persistent increased urine albumin excretion and for a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Diabetes CKD is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world5 and it is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events6, which in turn remain the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus3,7,8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition to genetic determinants9, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased blood pressure (BP) and smoking are known to be risk factors for the onset and progression of diabetic renal damage10,11. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The natural history of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus has traditionally been associated with an increase in urinary albumin excretion rate (AER), which is the first sign of renal damage and may foster progression to macroalbuminuria and later on decrease in GFR12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>More recently however, several studies have provided a more heterogeneous picture of renal phenotype in T1D patients with CKD, with a significant number of patients progressing towards ESRD in the absence of albuminuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Whether renal lesions found in non albuminuric CKD are specifically due to diabetes or may in part recognize different pathogenetic mechanisms is sometimes difficult to ascertain in clinical practice as renal biopsies are not routinely performed in most of these patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Whereas renal impairment and albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus shared a number of risk factors, there also was a distinct set of variables, which predicted one but not the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept that albuminuria and renal impairment may not necessarily reflect the same underlying pathophysiological mechanism in type 1 diabetes mellitus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, some peculiarities need to be mentioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>First of all, in our setting, worse glycemic control appears to play a significant role in increasing the risk of developing CKD, with some specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In fact, while in the univariate model increased HbA1c associated with CKD risk and each of its components, in the multivariate model we found a 13% greater risk for CKD and a 16% greater risk for albuminuria onset for each 1% increase in HbA1c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>We could not detect any significant association between glycemic control and reduced eGFR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This finding clearly supports the strong role of glycemic control as a risk factor for albuminuria in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with a minor role for renal impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>A weak relationship between glucose control and GFR decline has also been reported by other observational and intervention studies such as the DCCT study17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the role of hyperglycemia as an established risk factor for albuminuria onset results also from several intervention studies18, including DCCT19, which unquestionably demonstrate that intensive glucose control results in a clinically important and durable reduction in the risk of albuminuria onset the role of glycemic control on the progression of kidney damage is not so clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Triglycerides also are strongly related to albuminuria onset but appear to have no significant effect on reduced eGFR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This finding has also been reported by Hadjadi et al. who described serum triglycerides as a predictive factor for the development and the progression of renal and retinal complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Moreover, low levels of triglycerides were associated with regression of microalbuminuria21. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Patients who went on to develop CKD and its components had a significantly higher baseline systolic BP as compared to those who remained with stable kidney function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, in our study, the deleterious effect of blood pressure disappeared in the multivariate model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This somewhat unexpected finding could be explained, at least in part, by the optimal BP control (i.e. mean BP = 125 ± 17/76 ± 9 mmHg) recorded in our study patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the presence (and degree) of antihypertensive treatment entails a more than two-fold risk of albuminuria onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Antihypertensive treatment could therefore be considered as a proxy of arterial hypertension, which can be the real driver of kidney damage onset. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The presence of retinopathy, either BR or PR, was more common among patients who developed CKD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>After fully adjusted analysis, PR remained strongly associated to albuminuria, which developed fifty-seven percent more often in patients with baseline PR as compared to those without retinopathy. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In contrast with results of previous studies22, we found no association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and renal outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may mainly be due to differences in the characteristics of the population studied, such as age and duration of disease, duration of follow up or difference in the definition of outcomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Among the first ones, we must acknowledge that the duration of follow-up is relatively short, although the mean age of patients (i.e. 44 years) and long duration of disease (i.e. 17 years) allowed us to record a significant number of events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Second, laboratory parameters, including serum creatinine were not measured in a single, centralized laboratory which may have led to some variability, especially in GFR estimation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In addition, information on albuminuria has been gathered only as a categorical trait and this may also have contributed to variability in the outcome measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Moreover, data regarding the entire 5-year follow-up period were available for most but not all patients and therefore caution should be taken not to generalize our findings, as mortality from competitive risk was not positively collected in the missing subgroup. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical features of the subgroup with missing values, however, were similar to that of the entire cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Finally, we did not screen our population for non-diabetic diseases predisposing to CKD development or for the use of nephrotoxic agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>However, considering the large number of patients recruited, their relative young age, the periodic visits they have had at diabetes centers and the extremely low incidence of non-diabetic kidney disease in this setting, we do not believe that non-diabetic diseases or nephrotoxic agents could have significantly affected our results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we should mention the large size and homogeneous clinical characteristics of study sample as well as the representative geographical distribution of the recruiting centers, which certainly contribute to a good representation of real life clinical conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In the present report we analyzed a large sample of patients with type 1 diabetes, (according to American Diabetes Association 2003 criteria) followed-up at 137 centers among those participating in the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) initiative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed using the data set of electronic medical records collected between 1st January, 2004 and 30th June, 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of the analysis, we considered only patients who were ≥18 years old and with a follow-up evaluation within 60 ± 6 months complete for data about estimated GFR (eGFR) and albuminuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Of 5,486 patients identified, we excluded those with albuminuria, eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a previous eGFR value discordant (i.e. &lt;60 mL min/1.73 m2) or those with missing data of antidiabetic treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Two-thousand-six-hundred- fifty-six patients from 118 clinics constitute the study population (Supplemental Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The use of specific classes of drugs (insulin, statins and two or more anti-hypertensive agents) was also evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Since normal ranges for HbA1c varied among centers, the percentage change with respect to the upper normal value (measured value⁄upper normal limit) was estimated and multiplied by 6.0 in order to allow comparisons among the centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Kidney function was assessed by serum creatinine and urinary albumin excretion measurements. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>A mixed logistic regression model with diabetes clinics fitted as random effect was used for each renal outcome to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models over the entire population were fitted including a missing indicator variable for patients without BMI value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models including serum uric acid and smoking status were performed separately as complete-case analysis for patients with all data available (1464 and 1362 patients, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>To derive a hierarchical tree of event risk, a logistic model for renal outcome (separately for eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria) was used to split the data recursively into subgroups selecting the variable with the minimum p-value (if significant &lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Continuous variables were analyzed for all values from the 5th to 95th percentile selecting the cut-point with the lowest p-value. </plain></SENT>
