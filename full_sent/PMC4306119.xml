</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The coronary arteries are a common and important site of atherosclerotic lesion development [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is believed that mechanical stresses resulting from intravascular pressure and flow may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The curvature and the presence of stenosis in coronary arteries result in considerable change to the flow field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Flow disturbances associated with a stenosis could contribute to modifications in the rate of plaque development, the direction of plaque extension and the composition of the plaque [2-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A detailed hemodynamic evaluation of disturbed flow and the spatial and temporal flow distribution patterns may give additional insight to understanding the progression of atherosclerosis and may have useful clinical value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to measure local flow patterns and mechanical forces in vivo with sufficient accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Computational models become a useful tool in that regard. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In recent decades, much progress had been made in research coupling medical imaging and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study cardiovascular hemodynamics [1,4-9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The methods developed could provide investigators with powerful new tools, rivaling and even surpassing experimental fluid mechanics methods to investigate the mechanisms of disease and to design medical devices and therapeutic interventions [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Torii et al. investigated the effects of wall compliance on coronary hemodynamics by coupling FSI analysis of the human RCA in conjunction with physiological velocity and pressure waveforms [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Johnston et al. compared models of Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow in four healthy right coronary arteries reconstructed from biplane angiograms [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Zeng et al. examined the effects of cardiac motion on right coronary artery hemodynamics [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Myers et al. investigated the effects of arterial geometry, pulsatile flow condition and dynamic vessel motion on flow patterns in a model with a patient specific right coronary artery geometry [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Tang et al. provided a review of the key steps and findings of their group's in image-based models for human carotid and coronary plagues [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In general the solution of a system of partial differential equations is only uniquely determined if the boundaries of the domain are imposed with necessary conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to perform the 3D simulations of blood flow in human arteries, proper boundary conditions need to be specified at the inlet and the outlet boundaries when solving the governing Navier-Stokes equations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition to the consideration of the well-posedness of the computational problem, more natural and realistic conditions relating pressure and velocity waveforms for image-based modeling may enable researchers to better quantify and predict the local pressure fields and flow distribution in the upstream and downstream domains of the patient specific stenotic artery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, improperly imposed boundary conditions may result in misleading hemodynamic information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Usually the velocity profile or the pressure profile is explicitly prescribed at the inlet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>There is a variety of approaches for the outlet boundary condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Three of the commonly used simple outlet conditions are prescribed velocity or pressure profile, or zero normal traction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Different combinations of the above mentioned boundary conditions at the inlet and the outlet have been applied by many researches [4,5,9-15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Several authors have studied the influence of the flow waveform and the spatial profile of the inlet velocity on CFD predictions of blood flow in human arteries [1,16-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Mark et al. demonstrated the importance of unsteadiness in a left anterior descending coronary artery flow phantom [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Ethier et al. examined the flow waveform effects on end-to-side anastomotic flow patterns [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Myers et al. investigated the effects of the inlet velocity profile and flow waveform on the flow patterns on the hemodynamics in the proximal, medial, and distal arterial regions of human right coronary artery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In their study, a zero-traction condition was imposed at the model outlet and a velocity profile was imposed at the inlet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>They compared three different inlet velocity profiles: a fully developed inlet velocity profile, a "blunt" inlet velocity profile, and a fully developed Dean-type velocity profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>They also used two flow waveforms: sinusoidal and physiological waveforms in the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>They concluded that changes in the inlet velocity profiles did not produce significant changes in the arterial velocity and wall shear stress patterns and the waveform shape is not a significant factor in the right coronary time-averaged WSS features [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Morbiducci et al. studied the influence of assumptions regarding velocity profiles at the inlet section of the ascending aorta. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>They concluded that the plausibility of the assumption of idealized velocity profiles as inlet boundary conditions can lead to misleading representations of the aortic hemodynamics both in terms of disturbed shear and bulk flow structures [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, not much work has been reported on comparing the effect of the different combinations of the inlet/outlet boundary conditions on the quantification of the pressure field and flow distribution patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of the different types of boundary conditions imposed at the inlet/outlet on the spatial and the temporal distribution patterns of the blood flow in a patient-specific stenotic right coronary artery. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In literature, the effect of the inflow boundary condition was investigated by examining the impact of the waveform and the shape of the spatial profile of the inlet velocity on the cardiac hemodynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Waveform dependence has been cited for flow in the aortic arch [18,23] and in an end-to-side anastomosis [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The study conducted by Myers et al. implies that waveform shape is not a significant factor in the right coronary artery time-averaged WSS features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Changes in the inlet velocity profiles did not produce significant changes in the arterial velocity and wall shear stress patterns [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Our study was performed to examine the influence of the type of boundary conditions imposed at the inlet and the outlet on the phasic variation and the spatial distribution patterns of important right coronary artery hemodynamic features (velocity, the WSS, pressure, the PD, and the WPG) in a patient specific stenotic right coronary artery model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Our results from this study indicate that the type of different boundary conditions imposed at the inlet and the outlet does not have significant effect on the spatial distribution patterns of the PD, the WPG and the WSS on the lumen surface of the artery in terms of where each quantity assumes maximum and where the minimum occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>However, the temporal distribution patterns and the magnitudes of the velocity, the WSS, the pressure, the PD, and the WPG can be impacted notably depending on the type of the boundary conditions imposed at the inlet and the outlet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>More in detail, it was observed that </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>â¢ The type of boundary conditions examined in this study does not have a significant effect on the time averaged mean PD, the mean WPG and the mean WSS on the lumen surface in the post-stenosis and the downstream regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>However, the boundary conditions have notable effect in the segment of the artery between the inlet and the first stenosis on the magnitude of the velocity at the center line, on the pressure, the PD, the WPG, and the WSS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>The fully developed velocity profile assumption maybe the cause of the difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if the local hemodynamics is the focus of the study, the inlet spatial velocity profile must be handled with caution for V-P and V-NS0 models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>â¢ When the inlet boundary is imposed by a velocity waveform, the V-P and V-NS0 models with different outlet boundary conditions result in indistinguishable velocity, the PD, the WPG and the WSS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>However, the temporal distribution patterns and the magnitudes of the pressure resulted from these two models are very different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The phasic variation of pressure in a cardiac cycle resulted from V-NS0 model is very different from that of the waveform extracted from the patient and thus may cause a misleading. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>â¢ When both of the velocity and the pressure waveforms are imposed at inlet/outlet boundaries, the shapes of the phasic profiles of the PD, the WPG, and the WSS only follow the shape of the velocity pulse waveform no matter whether it is imposed at the inlet or the outlet boundary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that the velocity boundary condition influents more than the pressure boundary condition on the phasic shape of the PD, the WPG, and the WSS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>â¢ P-NS0 model is not a practical mathematic model for the simulation of the blood flow in stenotic right coronary artery and it results in extremely large values of the PD and the WPD and a large variation of the WSS, which obviously are not realistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>It also results in a wrong shape of the pulse velocity waveform. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>â¢ The analysis of the sensitivity of the blood flow simulation on the pressure outlet boundary condition was also carried out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>For the model with a pulse velocity waveform imposed at the inlet boundary (V-P), a 1% mean perturbation of the pulse pressure waveform (3% at the peak flow time) imposed at the outlet boundary will only cause a change of 0.5% in the maximum mean pressure drop and no change in the maximum mean WPG and the maximum mean WSS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, for a model with a pulse pressure waveform imposed at the inlet boundary (P-P), the same amount of perturbation on the pulse pressure waveform imposed at the outlet boundary will result in a 7% change of the maximum mean PD, a 7% change of the maximum mean WPG, and a 5% change of the maximum mean WSS and a 6% change of the minimum mean WSS, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that the magnitudes of these hemodynamic features are more sensitive to the outlet pressure boundary condition in the P-P model than to that in the V-P model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the accuracy of the measurement of the outlet pressure data from the patient is more important to the blood simulation in a patient specific P-P model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>â¢ Comparing the plots of the inlet velocity and pressure waveforms with the plot of the pressure waveform at the outlet boundary, we can clearly see the influence of the flow rate on the pressure drop in a cardiac cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>From the inlet to the outlet, the total pressure drop is larger at the time associated with each local maximum point of the inlet velocity waveform during a cardiac cycle, and the maximum pressure drop occurs at the peak flow (t = 0.425). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>A linear regression analysis on the correlation between the inlet pulse velocity magnitude and the percentage change of the pressure ((Pin(t)-Pout(t))/Pin(t)) reveals a correlation coefficient r = 0.9103 with p-value of 0.0000, and a linear fitting function: the percentage change of the pressure = 0.2134*velocity-0.0356 with R-square = 0.8286. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the observations based on the computer simulations in this study indicated that the ways how pressure and velocity boundary conditions are imposed in computational models have considerable impact on flow velocity and shear stress predictions, especially in upstream region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations with improperly imposed type of boundary conditions may result in some misleading hemodynamic information, especially on the temporal distribution patterns and the magnitudes of the blood flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of in vivo measurements of blood pressure and velocity is of great importance for reliable model predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>It must be recalled that we have examined only one artery in this work, and therefore any conclusions that we can draw are limited. </plain></SENT>
