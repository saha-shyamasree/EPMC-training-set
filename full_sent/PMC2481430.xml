</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is believed that in human and other eutherian mammals, the heteromorphic sex chromosomes evolved from a pair of ordinary autosomes between 166 and 148 million years ago [1-4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After the birth of the sex-determining gene, extensive recombination suppression evolved between proto-X and proto-Y to prevent the sexual reversal along the entirety of the chromosome pair, with the exception of a short 'pseudoautosomal region' (PAR) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Theoretical models predict that proto-Y chromosomes would further suffer a rapid accumulation of deleterious mutations and be subjected to drastic gene loss [6], consistent with only 45 genes surviving on the human Y chromosome as compared with 1,000 functional genes on the X [1,3,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Y degeneration is expected to be driven by multiple forces, including Muller's ratchet, background selection, the Hill-Robertson effect with weak selection, and the 'hitchhiking' of deleterious alleles by favorable mutations [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These factors can work on both ancient Y and heterosynaptic autosomes with suppressed recombination because of the diminished efficiency of natural selection along them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Newly evolved sex chromosome systems are required to test hypotheses about Y degeneration because ancient Y chromosomes bear few remaining traceable ancestral sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such cases include the recently originated sex determination system, like that of Silene [8], or 'neo-sex chromosomes', formed through a recent fusion or translocation between an autosome and a sex chromosome followed by extensive recombination suppression, and thus showing inheritance patterns like that of the better known ancient sex chromosomes [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Our current knowledge of neo-sex chromosome evolution is primarily due to extensive work in Drosophila and plants [8,10-12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Most of them focused on degeneration patterns in protein-coding regions of neo-Y alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, given the elaborate regulation of gene expression [13,14], the scenarios of Y degeneration involving both gradual loss of functions of protein products as well as regulatory disorders remain to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sex chromosome systems have evolved independently in different phyla many times, creating a need to examine their evolution in different taxa [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Sex chromosomes in mammals, including our own, have different autosomal origins from those of other organisms, involving entirely distinct gene sets in the process of sex determination and dosage compensation [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of recombination between the mammalian proto-X and proto-Y was achieved through chromosomal inversions on the Y chromosome, whereas it was achieved through zero crossover in male germline cells in Drosophila [5,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Finally, different generation time and population size between mammals and other species would have great impact on the rate and patterns of mammalian Y-chromosome degeneration [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, direct investigation of a neo-sex chromosome system in a mammal promises new insights into several fundamental issues, including both mode and tempo of mammalian Y degeneration, and how mammals cope with degenerated Y alleles before the creation of Xist-dependent dosage compensation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this study we sought to address these questions using the black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons), an Asian barking deer, as the model [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this species, a male-specific extensive chromosome inversion on autosome 4 and fusion of its homolog to the ancient X [21,22] has led to the very recent creation (within the past approximately 0.5 million years) [23] of a neo-sex chromosome system, similar to the inferred creation of the ancient mammalian X-Y system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Such a rare nascent mammalian neo-sex chromosome system provides an unprecedented opportunity to study sex chromosome evolution in mammals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The black muntjac is endemic to a narrow region of southeastern China [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Habitat disruption in recent decades has rendered the species one of the most endangered mammals in the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis revealed a compact karyotype, with 2n = 8â/9â, and half of the genome forms a pentavalent (Figure 1a) during male meiosis [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 4 pair has been shaped by several large chromosomal events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>First, one copy experienced a centric fusion to the regular X chromosome, forming a new 'X+4' (see Additional data file 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In addition, the short arm of chromosome 1 has undergone a male-specific translocation to the homologous chromosome 4, creating a primitive '1p+4' chromosome [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, subsequent inversions involving large part of the primitive 1p+4 were proposed to take place in male black muntjacs (regions from '22a' to '17a'; Additional data file 1) [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We further confirmed this chromosomal rearrangement using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac vaginalis) as probes (Figure 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The green signal in the middle of X+4 has switched its location to the distal end of 1p+4 as a result of the inversion (Figure 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Because no inversion loop has been detected during meiosis of male black muntjacs [24], the whole 1p+4 should remain heterosynaptic except for the two distal ends, which are not involved in the inversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These two ends are analogous to those of ancient human Y chromosome, which can still synapse with each other and can thus be regarded new 'PAR's. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The X+4 chromosome can thus be regarded as a 'neo-X', and the 1p+4 as a 'neo-Y' chromosome, because of probable lack of recombination in the inverted region. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Although X-autosome fusions were also detected in other muntjac species, such 1p+4 inversion is found exclusively in male black muntjacs [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The absence of such a system within Muntiacus genus, from which black muntjac is estimated to have diverged within the past 0.5 million years [23], indicates a very recent origin, and makes this system the youngest known mammalian neo-sex systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Variation pattern in neo-Y noncoding regions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To seek molecular evidence for inhibition of recombination and to compare the evolutionary patterns of neo-X and neo-Y chromosomes, we sequenced the intergenic and intronic fragments from the inverted region composing a total of 35.1 kilobases (kb), as well as 12.6 kb from the new 'PAR's and autosomal regions for two male and one female black muntjacs, as well as the orthologous segments from one male Indian muntjac, which is taken as the outgroup. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Under neutrality, intraspecific genetic diversity (Î¸) is expected to be proportional to the effective population size (Ne) times the mutation rate (Î¼; specifically, Î¸ = 4NeÎ¼) [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if recombination has authentically ceased between neo-Y and neo-X, then we would expect a reduced DNA polymorphism caused by reduced Ne for the neo-Y regions [6,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the polymorphism level of neo-Y should be similar to that of 'PAR' regions or autosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the former expectation, we found a significantly lower number of segregating sites (Ï2 test, P &lt; 0.01; see Materials and methods [below]) and a lower polymorphism level of neo-Y regions (0.00168 Â± 0.00120 versus 0.00190 Â± 0.00029) compared with regions that undergo homologous meiotic pairing (Table 1), indicating suppression of recombination between neo-Y and neo-X. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Of course, other factors including the Hill-Robertson effect, background selection, hitchhiking effect, or Muller's ratchet could have all reduced the polymorphism level within the investigated noncoding regions [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 'male-driven evolution' effect, which proposes that the neo-Y would undergo more rounds of cell division per generation in male than in female germlines, would increase the mutation rate and polymorphism level of neo-Y alleles compared with those of neo-X and autosomes [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Our phylogenetic analysis of neo-X and neo-Y sequences in the male black muntjac confirms that the neo-Y alleles have accumulated far more mutations than neo-X (Figure 2; statistically significant, by Tajima's relative rate tests, P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Such a drastic difference in the degeneration rate between neo-Y chromosomes of mammals and Drosophila could be attributable to the great differences in their mutation rates (2.2 Ã 10-9 versus 3.1 Ã 10-7 per base per year for mammal and Drosophila, respectively) [39,40], generation time, DNA repair efficiencies [41], and effective population size [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that, during the nonlinear process of mammalian Y degeneration [3], the rate of gene loss might be very slow in the early stage of mammalian Y chromosome evolution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Multiple factors can fix the above neo-Y specific mutations in populations in both coding and noncoding regions, such as Muller's ratchet, background selection, hitchhiking effects on linked deleterious mutations, and faster mutation rate in males [6,28,42,43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Muller's ratchet must have had strong effect on accumulation of these mutations, given that the number of mutant-free chromosomes in a population is positively correlated with the effective population size (Ne) [6,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Because of the usual small Ne values of mammals, mutant-free neo-Y alleles should be vulnerable to an irreversible loss by random drift by the 'ratchet' process, which further leads to accumulation of deleterious mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>It is less likely that the observed neo-Y variations were from either ancestral polymorphism or gene conversion between neo-X and neo-Y, because we used both female black muntjac and Indian muntjac genes as the references to define neo-Y mutations [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>It is also less likely that there were recent selective sweeps on the neo-Y of the black muntjac, based on the DNA polymorphism data. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>One of the fundamental issues in the process of Y-chromosome degeneration is whether it is mainly driven by direct degradation of the protein products (for example, in D. miranda) or reducing gene expression levels on an evolving Y [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that these two processes may work in concert after the immediate recombination suppression on the neo-Y chromosome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>After accumulation of such mutations in the protein coding regions, a subsequent reduced expression of Y would be favored by natural selection to prevent the production of defective Y-linked products [6,18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In the case of CLTC and SNX22, both are broadly expressed genes in most of the human tissues, with orthologs present in all vertebrates whose genomes have been sequenced.
