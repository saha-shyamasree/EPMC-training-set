</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In recent years, epidemiological and clinical studies have linked obesity to the development and progression of kidney injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Obesity is considered an important factor for developing end‐stage renal disease, behind only to proteinuria 1, 2, 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Obesity‐associated kidney injury in human subjects is characterized by structural remodelling of the kidney tissue and includes tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, arterial sclerosis and glomerulomegaly 2, 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>While obesity is clearly related to kidney injury, the pathophysiological mechanisms are far from clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A persistent and crucial component of obesity‐related tissue injury is chronic inflammation resulting from the production of pro‐inflammatory molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and macrophage infiltration 10, 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the kidneys of obese animal models, preventing inflammation protects against renal dysfunction and tissue remodelling 9, 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A major driver of inflammation in obesity is elevated levels of saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) 12, 13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>SFAs including lauric acid (C12:0), PA (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) are pro‐inflammatory lipid compounds known to activate inflammatory signalling in a wide range of cells 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>PA is the most abundant SFA in blood, and the most studied in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and vascular disorders 8, 13, 14, 19, 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We 11 and others 8, 16 have shown that PA is a potent stimulus for the production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, as well as activation of nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that elevated SFAs may initiate inflammatory injury through activating toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TLR4 is a critical pattern recognition receptor and is well known for recognizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram‐negative bacteria 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The LPS response requires a mediating protein called MD2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Upon binding to LPS, the LPS‐MD2‐TLR4 complex forms and activates downstream pro‐inflammatory signalling cascades, leading to the activation of NF‐κB, activating protein‐1 (AP‐1) and mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) 23, and then induces cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐ (IL) 1β, IL‐6 and interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) 15, 24, 25, 26, 27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>MD2 plays an important role in LPS‐induced innate immunity and inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether MD2 is required in SFA/obesity‐induced inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the causal relation of MD2 in renal inflammatory injury in the HFD‐induced model of obesity, PA‐challenged mice, and cultured renal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that MD2 is an important regulator of HFD‐ and SFA‐induced renal inflammatory injury. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In our study, we have used established mouse models of obesity to test a novel mechanism centred on inflammatory injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that kidneys in obese mice express more MD2 protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that MD2 is essential for the development and the progression of renal inflammatory injury in obesity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Mice fed a HFD presented with a greater KW/BW ratio than mice fed the standard chow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This ratio was maintained despite a steady gain of body weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the KW/BW ratio in the KO‐HFD mice was comparable to MD2 control diet mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the kidney weight gain was pathological, and not attributed to normal adaptive growth stimulated by diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>A characteristic lesion associated with obesity is glomerulomegaly and glomerulosclerosis, manifesting as increased deposition of connective tissue matrix, cellular proliferation and leucocytic infiltration 2, 10, 36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Our histological analyses of renal tissue from mice on HFD or with increased circulating PA are consistent with this type of tissue remodelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We have shown increased deposition of collagen and glycogen as well as increased macrophage infiltration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>These pathological tissue changes are not evident in the MD2 knockout mice or mice with pharmacological MD2 inhibition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>A crucial component of the renal inflammatory injury is leucocytic extravasation and infiltration into the renal tissue sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Macrophage infiltration, as indicated by increased CD68 localization in renal tissue, occurred in mice fed a HFD or challenged with PA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Infiltrated macrophages that take up residence in the renal tissue are likely to be highly activated, secreting pro‐inflammatory cytokines, chemoattractants, growth factors and damaging oxidants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This in turn may create a vicious positive feedback system to recruit other leucocytes and produce more pro‐inflammatory molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, at least, renal tubular cells, mesangial cells and macrophages could contribute significantly to this positive feedback cycle of inflammation in renal tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We observed that macrophages adhered to PA‐stimulated tubular cells and mesangial cells in culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Activated tubular or mesangial cells may provide a recruiting platform for macrophages into kidney tissue sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that all of three cell types were potently activated by PA to produce cytokines, chemokines, and induce adhesion molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>We believe that this may create a MD2‐dependent locus of inflammatory activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In addition, blockade of TLR4 signalling should improve insulin sensitivity in HFD‐treated mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Thus, MD2 blockage may also improve the insulin sensitivity here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Although the protection of MD2 blockage against renal injury is accompanied with the inhibition of inflammation in mice, it is difficult to exclude the effects of improved insulin sensitivity on renal protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In order to ascribe the renal protection to inflammatory inhibition, we used the in vitro study in renal cells (NRK‐52E and SV40), in which, MD2 inhibition directly blocked the inflammation induced by PA stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>We think that the anti‐inflammatory effect of TLR4/MD2 blockage may be the most upstream mechanism for the phenotypic protections in HFD‐fed mice, including renal injury in HFD mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the improvement on insulin sensitivity by TLR4/MD2 blockage also results from the inflammatory decrease in HFD‐fed mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Also, it is interesting that the triglycerides are not elevated in MD2 knockout mice on HFD (Fig. S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>This prompts the question whether lowering triglycerides is the mechanism of renoprotective action of MD blockage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, we do not know the mechanism yet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Such notes will be further studied by us in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Our experimental elevation of the circulating PA, a predominant SFA, in mice resulted in inflammatory renal injury mimicking that produced by HFD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge that it will be better to measure saturated fatty acids or PA in mouse kidney tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find any commercial kits for the examination of PA level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The levels of FFA in control kidney and obese kidney were shown in the Figure S10, which indicated that FFA level in HFD mouse kidney was significantly higher than that in control mouse kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>MD2 knockout mice were protected against development of PA‐induced renal injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>These finding have two important implications: i) PA is likely a predominant SFA responsible for the HFD‐associated renal inflammatory injury; and ii) the mechanism(s) by which PA induces the pathological changes were mediated mostly through MD2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>We suspect that an upstream initiating event stimulated by PA is the formation of the MD2‐TLR4 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, several questions remain unanswered and should be the focus of future studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>For example, the elucidation of direct cellular targets of PA in kidney tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In addition, understanding inflammatory stress‐induced cellular activities that regulate the progression towards renal injury would be crucial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that many, if not all, cell types of kidney tissue are responsive to direct stimulation by SFAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>These cells include macrophages 14, mesangial cells 7, vascular endothelial cells 20, podocytes 37 and smooth muscle cells 13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to unravel this complex but important pathogenic mechanism of obesity‐associated renal injury. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results confirm that HFD induces an inflammatory state of renal tissue, with progression towards renal tissue remodelling and functional deficits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>PA, the most predominant circulating SFA, is the likely SFA responsible for the renal tissue inflammation, tissue remodelling, and dysfunction observed in HFD‐fed mice. </plain></SENT>
