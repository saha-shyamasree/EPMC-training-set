</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Invertebrates lack the typical adaptive immune responses of vertebrates but are endowed with effective defense mechanisms against infectious challenge [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They comprise both cellular and humoral responses mediated by multiple soluble factors and cell-associated receptors that can recognize pathogens and lead to effector functions, including opsonization, phagocytosis, coagulation cascades and expression of antimicrobial peptides [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Pathogen recognition functions that involve protein-carbohydrate interactions are mostly mediated by both soluble and cell-associated lectins, which are critical components of the innate immune responses in both vertebrates and invertebrates [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on their carbohydrate specificity, divalent cation requirements, presence of conserved sequence motifs in their carbohydrate binding domains (CRDs), and most recently their structural folds, animal lectins have classified into several families such as C-, F-, I- and P- type lectins, ficolins and galectins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Among these, the galectins, formerly known as S-type lectins, constitute a multifunctional albeit structurally conserved family of β-galactoside-binding proteins, which contain one or more CRDs per subunit sharing a conserved sequence motif, and are widely distributed among eukaryotic taxa [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In mammals, up to 15 distinct galectins (galectin-1 to 15) have been described that fall into three structural types: proto type, with one CRD per subunit and mostly form non-covalently-bound dimers, the chimera type, also with one CRD and an N-terminal polypeptide extension that enables subunit oligomerization into trimers and pentamers, and the tandem repeat type, in which two CRDs are covalently joined by a linker peptide [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Initially described as mediating embryogenesis and development by binding to endogenous glycans, in recent years galectins have been shown as key regulators of immune homeostasis [7]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>More recently, however, the elucidation of their roles in multiple aspects of innate immune responses of vertebrates has included the direct recognition of microbial pathogens and function as pattern recognition receptors [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to recognizing endogenous ‘self’ glycans, galectins can recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns consisting of similar ‘non-self’ carbohydrate moieties [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In invertebrates, galectins are thought to participate in biological processes that are common to those from vertebrates based on ‘self’ and ‘non-self’ recognition described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, relatively few studies about the biological roles of galectins in invertebrates have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A galectin (CvGal1) of unique CRD organization from the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, can recognize a large number of environmental bacterial species and strains, as well as phytoplankton microalgae [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CvGal1 is up-regulated by infectious challenge with trophozoites from the parasite Perkinsus marinus, and promotes their phagocytosis by binding both to the hemocyte surface (‘self’) glycans as well as the parasite surface (‘non-self’) sugars [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The parasite glycans recognized by CvGal1 are structurally different from those recognized on the oyster hemocytes [16], [17], and as an example of carbohydrate-based molecular mimicry the interactions with CvGal1 facilitate host entry by the parasite [13], [14], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A similar galectin (McGal) that is upregulated by microbial challenge and can recognize microbial pathogens and parasites was later described in the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As the consumer demand for farmed shrimp has continued to increase worldwide, so has the rate of infectious disease in the aquaculture industry settings, and there is an urgent need to address mechanistic questions concerning the shrimp immune responses to microbial pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although various aspects of the roles of antimicrobial peptides, C-type lectins, and other immune factors have been characterized in considerable detail [20]–[22], galectins have been described in only a few crustacean species [23], and no functional studies have been reported so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified and characterized a galectin from the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus, which we designated MjGal (Marsupenaeus japonicus galectin). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The expression of MjGal is up-regulated upon bacterial challenge, and the protein bind to bacteria through the recognition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>By also binding to the shrimp hemocyte surface, MjGal functions as an opsonin for microbial pathogens, promoting their phagocytosis and clearance from circulation, and thereby contributing to the shrimp’s immune defense against infectious challenge. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Although galectins were initially described as developmentally regulated in their expression and playing key roles in early embryogenesis, cell differentiation, and tissue organization, in recent years evidence has accumulated in support of their participation in regulation of immune homeostasis by modulating inflammation and multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, including leukocyte chemotaxis, migration and activation [29], B cell development [9], [30], T cell apoptosis [8], [31], and other regulatory aspects of the immune responses of vertebrates [7]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Further, during the past few years it has become increasingly clear that galectins also bind glycans on the surface of potentially pathogenic microbes and can function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in vertebrates, galectins can regulate immune functions by binding to both endogenous (‘self’) glycans, and microbe-associated (‘non-self’) glycotopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Although in invertebrates, galectins are thought to participate in those biological processes that are common to vertebrates, relatively few studies have documented their binding to self and non-self glycans and any role(s) in immune function comparable to those from vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Moreover, galectins have been described only in a few crustacean species, including the Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis (GenBank: ADF32023.1), the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (GenBank: AGV04659.1), and the water flea D. pulex (GenBank: AFI40275.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>These studies, however, have been mostly limited to the identification of galectin transcripts, with no further analysis of their biological role(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the functional characterization of crustacean galectins warrants further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified and functionally characterized for the first time a novel galectin from the kuruma shrimp, M. japonicus. The shrimp galectin is upregulated by infectious challenge, and can recognize and opsonize potentially pathogenic bacteria by binding to the hemocyte surface and promoting phagocytosis, and silencing of its expression in vivo results in reduced bacterial clearance rates in hemolymph, suggesting that MjGal plays a key role in immune defense against bacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>A search of our M. japonicus EST database revealed a transcript that we designated MjGal with homology to members of the galectin family, encoding a 333-amino acid long protein of 33.5 kDa apparent mass that displays a single 127-residue long galactoside-binding lectin domain located in the N-terminal half of the polypeptide chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The primary structural organization of the transcript indicated that it does not fit the canonical features of the proto or chimera type galectins from vertebrates [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Although the MW of MjGal would suggest that it is related to the latter galectin type, the location of the CRD is opposite to the vertebrate representatives, in which the CRD is located closer to the C-terminal region [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the organization of the MjGal transcript is quite similar to the galectin DpGal-2, from the water flea D. pulex that houses a 127-amino acid long CRD linked to a low complexity region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicated a closest similarity to galectins identified in the shrimp L. vannamei and the crab E. sinensis, but in spite of the similar transcript organization, a significantly lower sequence similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the proposed rapid adaptive evolution of immune genes in Daphnia [23] that has resulted galectin sequences that are substantially divergent from other crustacean species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>A phylogenetic analysis indicated that MjGal clustered with galectins from invertebrates and a hemichordate, and was clearly distinct from the vertebrate galectins group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>MjGal was expressed in all tissues tested in the naïve animals, and upon infectious challenge, MjGal expression was significantly upregulated in both hemocytes and hepatopancreas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In crustaceans, most C-type lectins involved in immune function are expressed in the hepatopancreas and released to the circulation [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the crustacean hemocytes are involved in various aspects of surveillance and cellular immune responses [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results strongly suggested that MjGal might be involved in antibacterial responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by in vivo bacterial clearance experiments that showed that bacteria that had been pre-incubated with MjGal and injected into shrimp were cleared more rapidly from circulation than those exposed to the control protein or buffer alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Although the role of invertebrate lectins (particularly of the C-type) in pathogen clearance has been demonstrated for several species, particularly insects [32] and mollusks [15], this is the first demonstration in a crustacean species that a galectin can promote bacterial clearance and contribute to immune defense against microbial pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms involved in bacterial clearance, we investigated whether MjGal directly recognized and bound to the bacterial surface. MjGal bound strongly to both G+ and G− bacteria, in a manner that could be partially or totally inhibited by LPS or LTA, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>However, although the binding could not be inhibited or outcompeted by lactose, a typical galectin ligand, but could be displaced by a detergent such as SDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MjGal also bound strongly to the hemocyte surface, but the binding could be inhibited (at least partially) by lactose, thereby confirming that like most galectins described to date, MjGal binds to galactosyl moieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of inhibitory effect of lactose on the binding of MjGal to bacteria requires alternative explanations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>First, due to the bacterial oligosaccharide structures or the architecture of their presentation on the microbial surface, MjGal may bind with higher affinity to microbial surface glycans relative to lactose, which is not able to outcompete the interactions even at high concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>These glycans would be different from those displayed on the hemocyte surface, to which MjGal would bind in a lactose-inhibitable manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Second, it is also possible that upon binding of MjGal to the microbial cell surface, a considerable disruption of bacterial membrane morphology takes place thereby exposing areas that establish secondary interactions (ie hydrophobic) with MjGal that are different from the initial protein-carbohydrate interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Displacement of these additional MjGal-bacteria interactions would require a detergent such as SDS, as observed in our experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>The disruption of membrane morphology in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells upon binding of galectins has been reported elsewhere [29], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Both human Gal-4 and Gal-8 directly kill BGB+ E. coli through recognition of bacterial surface carbohydrates via a mechanism that drastically alters membrane integrity and bacterial motility [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Solid phase binding experiments showed that both LTA and LPS, but not PGN, can be potential targets for MjGal-mediated recognition of the surface of G+ and G− bacteria, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The binding of bacterial glycans by invertebrate lectins has been described for insect and mollusks, with LPS and PGN being the more frequently recognized targets [13], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of the MjGal binding to the for LPS and LTA suggest that MjGal affinities for these glycans are different, although it is likely that its capacity for recognition will depend on their density, presentation, and distribution on the microbial surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>This, as well as the detailed structural aspects of the interactions that will enable to explain the different affinities warrants further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>The mutant rMjGalΔ102–106 in which two conserved cysteine residues and three additional residues in the CRD were deleted, showed a relatively weaker binding activity for bacteria, LPS or LTA, than that of the wild type rMjGal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>This confirmed that the binding of rMjGal to the ligands tested takes place via the five canonical amino acid residues in the CRD, but also suggests that other amino acid residues in an extended CRD might contribute to the lectin-ligand interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome of the binding of MjGal to both microbial pathogens and the shrimp hemocyte surface was the enhancement of phagocytosis of bacteria by the hemocytes, as experimentally demonstrated in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>This opsonic effect of MjGal for bacteria that may have invaded the shrimp internal milieu became the rationale to propose the hypothesis that MjGal-mediated opsonization might be the mechanism by which MjGal enhances the clearance of potential microbial pathogens from circulation as initially observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>The oyster galectin CvGal1 binds to the surface of a variety of microbes as well as the parasite Perkinsus marinus and the pre-incubation of hemocytes with and anti-CvGal1 antibody significantly reduced phagocytosis, thus confirming that hemocyte surface-bound CvGal1 participated in the uptake of cross-linked microbes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>As MjGal can bind to both the microbial and the hemocyte surface, it is possible that MjGal functions in a similar way to CvGal1, as a receptor on the surface of hemocytes or as a soluble opsonin to promote phagocytosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>The MjGal RNAi silencing experiments rigorously tested this hypothesis in vivo, and revealed the numbers of bacteria in the hemolymph of MjGal-knockdown shrimp were significantly higher than in the control groups, particularly during the acute phase around the first 5 min, thereby confirming that MjGal plays a key role in the bacterial clearance from shrimp hemolymph and therefore, in the animal’s defense against bacterial infection. </plain></SENT>
