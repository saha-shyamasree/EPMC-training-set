</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There is no effective medical therapy for women and men infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Persistent infection with specific HPV types carries a high risk of progression from pre-malignant to invasive and metastatic cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The prototype HPV associated with “high-risk” of neoplastic transformation is HPV-16, which accounts for ~50% of all cervical cancers across the world [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The HPV E6 protein is essential for viral replication and instrumental in bypassing host cell defenses and preventing apoptosis [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The high risk E6 protein binds to the HECT domain ubiquitin ligase, E6AP/UBE3A and this complex is responsible for ubiquitinylation of the p53 protein, a major suppressor of tumorigenesis, resulting in its degradation by the cellular proteasome [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This effect can be reversed in HPV-driven tumor cells by reduced expression of HPV E6, which reactivates p53 expression and leads to senescence or apoptosis [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Additional cellular factors interact with HPV E6 and may be targeted for degradation [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These significant activities make E6 a compelling target for the treatment of HPV-associated infections. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Peptide ligands for the E6 hydrophobic groove that were derived from the alpha-helical LXXLL motif of E6AP have been characterized previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While comparatively low in binding affinities, these peptides are able to disturb E6/E6AP interaction [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A chimeric protein that contains the LXXLL motif and the PDZ motif displays much higher binding affinity when compared to the LXXLL motif alone [16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a novel small peptide unrelated to the E6AP binding motif, also inhibits E6 function by blocking the interaction of E6 with E6AP [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Additional peptide-based protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPI) have achieved some partial successes [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The LXXLL containing alpha-helix binds in a hydrophobic pocket of E6 [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the specific interface of the HPV-16 E6 protein with E6AP and its other LXXLL binding partners presents significant opportunities for targeting with small molecules (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Despite the large overall surface area (902–1005 Å) for the groove, we and others have previously identified flavonoid derived compounds as E6 inhibitory compounds [23–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A limited structure-activity study identified a tetrazole-substituted benzopyranone analog that antagonized HPV-16 E6 in vitro and had effective IC50 values in the lower micromolar range [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Initial molecular modeling studies showed that these compounds could bind within the hydrophobic groove of the E6 protein that has been shown to contact E6AP [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The motivation for the current study was to understand the contribution of the 2’-6’ substitution groups on the benzopyranone scaffold and to determine what features of E6 are involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We observed increased inhibitory activity of small molecules with charged groups at position 6 as well as a higher activity for compounds with non-polar substituents at the 2 position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, a subset of analogs was selected to probe E6 binding interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Molecular dynamics simulations of the HPV-16 E6 protein implicated a high degree of flexibility of charged residues along the helix groove that could dominate small molecule interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A focused set of mutations at these amino acids revealed important roles in defining the molecular interactions of the E6 hydrophobic groove and offered insights for future structure-guided ligand design. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The observed MBP-E6 in vitro p53 degradation activity was comparable to that observed for a mutant MBP-E6 in which six or four (bold) cysteines (C16, C51, C80, C97, C111, C140) were all replaced with serines [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Purified MBP protein denaturation showed a Tm of 59.7 ± 0.1°C, which is comparable to wild-type MBP protein (62.3°C; pH 8.2 [34]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The slight difference in our assay (pH 6.8) is due to the reported pH sensitivity of MBP [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>MBP-E6 fusion proteins displayed increased basal fluorescence compared to MBP alone, implying that MBP does not limit accessibility of the E6 protein to Sypro Orange (Fig 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Analysis of thermal stability of fusion-proteins could result in two melt peaks from unfolding of the MBP and E6 domains. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The melting temperature of purified wild-type E6 alone is difficult to assess due to its aggregation-prone nature [35, 36]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The roles and contributions of the 2–6 functional groups on the benzopyranone core were investigated to gain insight regarding the potential sites of interactions with HPV E6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Compounds CAF-24, CAF-25 and CAF-26 displayed similar apparent binding with the E6AP displacement assay using MBP-E6 fusion proteins (Fig 3A, Fig 4) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To further establish the TSA as a means to measure direct compound binding to HPV-16 E6, we first determined the MBP and MBP-16 E6 melt curves in response to increasing doses of maltose (Fig 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>We observed similar ΔTm changes in response to maltose with both proteins, indicating comparable accessibility of the MBP tag (Fig 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The E6 inhibitor CAF-25 stabilized purified MBP-E6 in a saturation-dependent manner (Fig 3D–3G and Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>MBP itself was either not affected or destabilized with these compounds, providing evidence for selective binding to the E6 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The destabilizing effect on MBP protein may contribute to the smaller global ΔTm changes detected with these compounds and MBP-E6 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relatively large MBP-tag could mask true ΔTm changes upon compound binding to the relatively small E6 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We observed that at 150 μM, some of the E6 inhibitors quenched the melt curve, hence we chose to compare the ΔTm changes at 50 μM (Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Compounds that performed consistently in the binding and TSA assays were investigated using the p53 in vitro degradation assay (Fig 3H; S1A Fig; and Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Compounds CAF-24, -25, -26 and CAF-40 showed similar efficiencies in the binding and functional E6 mediated p53 degradation assays, while CAF-27 exhibited lower than expected efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This may be due to lower binding affinity as indicated by the smaller ΔTm changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Compounds with a tetrazole group in the 6' position of the benzopyranone core showed enhanced selectivity for the E6 protein when compared with the benzoate functional group at the same position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>There also appears to be preference for non-polar substituent in positions 3 and 4 of 2-aryl group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>While unsaturated ketones are prone to be pan assay interference (PAINS) compounds [37, 38], we believe that the observed interaction of tetrazole-based flavone compounds with E6 shows specificity based on the following evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Probes did not 1) inhibit the binding of FLAG beads to FLAG-tagged E6AP-BAP peptide, indicating no interference with BAP activity itself or interference of antibody recognition of the fusion protein, 2) inhibit interaction of hDLG with E6AP-BAP peptide [25], or 3) stabilize MBP protein in the TSA. </plain></SENT>
