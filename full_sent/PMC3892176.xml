<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been approved for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In NSCLC, ALK activation occurs via chromosomal translocation, leading to activation of the kinase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, ALK is also known to be mutated in the context of the full-length receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), this being most clearly understood in neuroblastoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer that stems from the sympathetic nervous system 3, most commonly originating in the adrenal glands, but also developing at additional sites in the neck, chest, and abdomen. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although there is currently no clinically approved specific treatment for ALK mutations in neuroblastoma, ongoing clinical trials are being conducted to determine the potential usefulness of ALK-targeted therapies for use in future treatment approaches 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Today, crizotinib (PF-02341066) is in use as a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC 12. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>One consistent problem with kinase inhibitors and their use in a more personalized therapy approach is the drug-resistant mutations that arise in response to treatment, most commonly within the ATP-binding site of the kinase in question. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to compare the results of this study with earlier phosphoproteomics analysis on oncogenic ALK fusion proteins, such as EML4–ALK and NPM–ALK 29,30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In terms of phosphorylation of ALK itself, these studies identified overlapping but not identical sites in the ALK intracellular domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Activation of full-length ALK results in phosphorylation of Tyr1278, Tyr1282, and Tyr1283, which lie in the Y′RAS′YY autophosphorylation motif in the activation loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Although our data do not allow us to comment on the order of phosphorylation within the Y′RAS′YY motif, they are in agreement with previous studies elucidating the mechanism of phosphorylation 44,45, and further support the use of antibodies against pTyr1278 as an indicator of ALK activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Another site commonly used to denote activation of the ALK receptor is Tyr1604, which is situated at the C-terminal tail of the receptor, and has been reported to be important for transformation activity and docking of phospholipase Cγ in studies on NPM–ALK 47. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Although antibodies against pTyr1604 are commonly used to assay ALK activity, the importance of Tyr1604 in the interaction of phospholipase Cγ with full-length ALK has not been confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The identification in this study reinforces the potential importance of this tyrosine in ALK activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Of the phosphorylated tyrosines identified outside of the activation loop, Tyr1507 of ALK lies within a consensus Shc-binding site (NPTpY), and has been shown to be critical for interaction of full-length ALK with Shc 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with earlier work on NPM–ALK 48. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The remaining tyrosines that are phosphorylated in response to ALK activation identified in this study, namely Tyr1078, Tyr1092, Tyr1096, Tyr1131, Tyr1584, and Tyr1586, have been poorly characterized in the context of the full-length ALK RTK, and determination of their significance requires further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>However, work on the oncogenic ALK fusion proteins implicates these residues in binding of IRS-1 (Tyr1096) 48, and SNT (FRS2) (Tyr1096 and Tyr1507) 49. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>As well as identifying tyrosine phosphorylation sites in ALK, we observed phosphorylation of Ser1086, Ser1281 and Thr1597 on ALK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Although this finding is intriguing, the significance of these phosphorylation events is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although the phosphorylation of RTKs on serine and threonine is well recognized, its role is much less understood than that of tyrosine phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, serine/threonine phosphorylation is known to have important regulatory functions for, for example, fibroblast growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor 50–51, and Kit 52, to name but a few. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Although information on the phosphorylation of ALK itself in response to activation represented an important part of the information obtained with this phosphoproteomics approach, the identification of candidate molecules phosphorylated in response to ALK activation was the primary aim of this investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The list of phosphoproteins contains both known and novel ALK signaling components, some of which have been characterized, but the majority of which remain to be investigated for their relevance in both physiological and pathological ALK signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Of those known candidates, several examples can be briefly mentioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>One molecule identified in our screen was FRS2, which was phosphorylated on Tyr349 in response to ALK activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>FRS2 has previously been reported to bind full-length ALK, although the binding site is unclear 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MAPK1 – which was phosphorylated on Thr183 in this study – has been shown by several groups to be phosphorylated upon stimulation of the ALK receptor 53. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>One of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins identified in this study was STAT3, which was phosphorylated on Tyr705 in response to ALK activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>STAT3 has been reported to be phosphorylated downstream of several of the oncogenic ALK fusion proteins 25,27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>To date, although several articles have reported STAT3 phosphorylation downstream of full-length ALK, the significance of this is unclear 8–56. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>One study of NPM–ALK has suggested that oncogenic ALK binds and activates STAT3 directly via the first tyrosine (Tyr1278) in the Y′RAS′YY motif of ALK 45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The crystal structures of ALK show that unphosphorylated Tyr1278 interacts with Cys1097 in the N-lobe of the kinase, implying that phosphorylation of Tyr1278 should make a binding site for STAT3 available, consistent with this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In this study, we saw clear phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705, which is particularly robust in response to oncogenic forms of the full-length ALK receptor, such as ALKF1174S, ALKΔexon 2–3, and ALKΔexon 4–1239,55. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Although it was not investigated in this study, it would be of interest to examine the importance of STAT3 phosphorylation in neuroblastoma cells harboring a wild-type nonactive ALK receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by inhibition of the NB1 neuroblastoma cells lines with crizotinib, which resulted in a loss of pSTAT3Y705, although the significance of STAT3 for cell growth was not discussed 54. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In light of the activation of STAT3 by ALK, we also investigated the interaction of ALK with STAT3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we observed an interaction of STAT3 with full-length ALK when overexpressed; however, this was not detectable at the level of endogenous proteins, suggesting that care should be taken when interpreting these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this is because of limitations of the antibodies employed here, or a masking of the epitope by the interaction, or simply a low level of endogenous interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying ALK activation of STAT3 are unknown, it is clear from these studies that loss of STAT3 activity, either by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of STAT3 or by addition of STAT3 inhibitors 41,42, reduces the growth and viability of four neuroblastoma lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>One key component examined here was the effect of STAT3 activity on MYCN levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Recent work has highlighted the cooperative roles of ALK and MYCN in neuroblastoma, with ALK impacting on both the level of MYCN transcription and the stability of the MYCN protein itself 34–37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Given these reports, our finding here that STAT3 is important for changes in MYCN levels in response to ALK signaling is significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Indeed, inhibition of STAT3 by addition of inhibitors, or by RNA interference, reduced MYCN levels even in the presence of activated ALK. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our phosphoproteomic analysis identifies a number of phosphorylation sites targeted by activation of the ALK RTK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>One prominent target identified in this analysis was STAT3, which we show here is important for the regulation of MYCN downstream of activated ALK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>From our investigations, it is also clear that there is a difference between the ability of wild-type ALK to activate STAT3 and that of oncogenically activated forms of ALK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying this difference are not known, and further work is required to understand this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This work suggests that STAT3 inhibition may be a viable approach in the regulation of MYCN activity in neuroblastoma cells, and may have potential therapeutic value in the future. </plain></SENT>
