</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of its "Doi Moi" or 'renovation' policy in 1986, Vietnam has shifted from a centrally planned towards a market-oriented economy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Health sector reform has introduced user fees in public hospitals and legalized private practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In urban centers in particular, the private health sector has been growing rapidly, and increasingly is in competition with the public sector in providing health services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These changes have produced profound effects on the use of health services at state health facilities, including RH care at the local CHS - the basic unit of the primary healthcare system in Vietnam [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To date, no study has examined the use of FP and primary RH services in the context of the current healthcare system in Vietnam, as it shifts from a state monopoly to a more pluralist system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To address this shortcoming, this study aims to describe the pattern of FP and RH service utilization among women at the CHS and other state and private facilities, and to explore socio-demographic determinants of RH service utilization at the CHS level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is intended to inform policy and program reviews that will strengthen the CHS primary RH network in the changing health system of Vietnam. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The state health system in Vietnam consists of 4 levels: the national level with the Ministry of Health and central hospitals; the provincial level with the Provincial Department of Health and provincial hospitals; the district level with district health centers and district hospitals; and the communal level with CHSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>RH and FP services are available at all-level state health facilities: central, provincial, district hospitals and CHSs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Despite the changes in the health sector, the CHS retains its responsibilities as the primary access point to primary RH and FP services subsidized by the state budget, and is required to meet government numerical targets on basic RH and FP service use indicators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Every CHS is staffed by at least one midwife who acts as the focal point for RH services, including antenatal and post-natal care, delivery, gynecological examination and treatment, and FP services such as IUD, oral contraceptives, and condoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Some CHSs located close to a hospital are restricted from providing delivery services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Local residents are entitled to free services at their local CHS but not at the CHS in other communes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition to everyday RH services, CHSs are entrusted with responsibilities to register and manage all pregnant women in the commune, conducting 1-day monthly antenatal check-ups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There are also 3-day semi-annual RH campaigns based at the CHS with assistance of midwifes or doctors from the district hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The primary purpose of these campaigns is early detection and treatment of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) including sexually transmitted infections, based on clinical examination [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Since the restructuring of the national population program, there is a network of population collaborators affiliated with the local CHS, who have basic training in RH health education and services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Population collaborators conduct regular outreach communication activities, providing RH counseling and contraceptives (e.g. condoms, pills), and referring couples to the CHS for further FP and RH services such as IUD insertion, gynecological and antenatal check-ups [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Private healthcare services in Vietnam comprise three differing service structures [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Private hospital care is principally located in major cities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Compared to state hospitals, they have a reputation for their access to more advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technology, and their capacity to provide technically demanding services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Private outpatient clinics are operated by individuals or groups of full- or part-time physicians in urban, sub-urban and rural areas, under a license from provincial health authorities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>They largely provide general or specialized health services for middle income patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Third, "mobile" private practitioners--who can be nurses, assistant doctors, or retired doctors--are commonly present in rural areas, providing health services from their own homes without a license. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These health practitioners are not included as part of the formal health system, although they play an important role in providing basic health services [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>For RH services at the commune level, private providers include doctors or practitioners (e.g. midwives, assistant doctors), and traditional birth attendants, who provide home-based delivery services [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In addition, local pharmacies can offer the commercial sale of birth control commodities such as oral contraceptives, without prescription. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>With the reduction in government subsidies for CHS facilities, equipment, and human resources development, the quality of health services at CHSs has been perceived as deteriorating and is associated with less-qualified health staff, outdated equipment, limited drugs and supplies [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the private sector has been increasingly popular and is associated with convenient opening hours, more competent staff, better equipment, and effective drug prescriptions [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Reports suggest that increasingly, patients are seeking care at private clinics or bypassing their local CHS for higher level health facilities, willing to pay higher fees based on their perceptions of better quality and enhanced technology [1,2,10,11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The Study Sites </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This study is part of the baseline assessment of a project supported by Marie Stopes International Vietnam, that aims to create public-private partnerships to improve access to services and the quality of primary RH care, in two provinces, Thua Thien Hue and Vinh Long, in Vietnam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Thua Thien Hue is located in the center of Viet Nam with a total population of 1,143,500, of which 284,149 women are at reproductive age (15 - 49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The province has 1 central hospital, 9 district hospitals, and 152 CHSs located in urban, semi-urban, rural, and mountainous areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Based in the Mekong delta region, Vinh Long province has a population of 1,057,000. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The state health care network consists of 107 CHSs, 8 district hospitals, and 1 provincial hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>People in districts bordering with Can Tho city may seek RH services at the Can Tho central hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Almost all CHSs in the 2 provinces are staffed by a doctor [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Studies sites included 1 urban district (Hue city), 2 rural districts of Thua Thien Hue, and 3 rural districts of Vinh Long. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>As these districts received no external support for primary RH care, they can be considered to represent the baseline for state provided RH services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In each of these districts, the state primary healthcare network was well-established, with each commune having a CHS and a team of population collaborators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In contrast, RH private clinics were mostly concentrated in urban areas, and were often run by a gynecologist working in a major hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Only 3 out of 5 rural districts had a gynecologist working in the district hospital and 2 rural districts in Vinh Long had an accredited private RH clinic (i.e. with a license from provincial health authorities) operated by this specialist [12]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The study was a cross-sectional survey, using a multi-stage cluster sampling design to recruit participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The first stage selected 5 communes from each of the selected districts, using proportional to population size techniques, totaling 30 communes in the 2 provinces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The second stage involved the random selection of 1 village or residential group in each commune where 30 households were randomly drawn for interviews of all women at reproductive age (15-49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In total, 900 households with 1 417 women were included in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Data was collected using questionnaire-based interviews, consisting of mutiple-choice questions on respondents' socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, marital status, occupation, education, number of living children, income), their RH and FP service use (see Additional File 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Women were also asked about the health facility where they attended antenatal care during their last pregnancy or received their most recent gynecological examination, and the place where they had their latest delivery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>These three RH services were considered to constitute basic RH healthcare provided at the local CHS or other state health facilities in Vietnam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Women were interviewed at home by a trained interviewer who was a member of the commune Women's Union. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Data collection was completed from April to May, 2010. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>As mentioned earlier, the research was undertaken as a baseline survey, commissioned by Marie Stopes International Vietnam for planning an intervention in the 2 selected provinces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval was given by the Ethic Committee of the Thua Thien Hue and Vinh Long Provincial Departments of Health. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Data were entered into Epi Info, then transferred to STATA version 9.0 for processing and analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of questionnaires were double entered to check consistency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Data analyses consisted of two sequential steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>First, descriptive analysis was performed of the socio-demographic characteristics of all study participants and the frequency distributions of variables of interest, including the current use of FP method(s), history of ANC, delivery, and gynecological check-up service use, and the health facility where women attended for their most recent service. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Second, logistic regression analyses were performed of factors related to the use of the following services in the local CHS: (i) antenatal check ups during the last pregnancy, (ii) their latest delivery, and (iii) their most recent gynecological examination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The dependent variable was based on whether or not women who visited a health facility for these services reported selecting their local CHS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Independent variables of interests included: women's age (above vs. below the median), number of living children (having 2 children or less vs. 3 children or more), religion (Buddhist, Catholic, other, and none), ethnicity (majority vs. minority), occupation (farming vs. other), education (secondary school or less vs. high school or more), income (4 quartile groups), current living location (urban vs. rural), and study province (Vinh Long vs. Thua Thien Hue). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The statistical model for the use of CHS delivery services excluded those who required a cesarean section and those who reported that delivery service was unavailable at their local CHS at the time the women gave birth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Each socio-demographic variable was analyzed first as a univariate predictor to obtain a crude odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Significantly related variables (p &lt;0.05) were subsequently included in a multivariate analysis to obtain an adjusted OR and 95% CI. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="458" pm="."><plain>This study is among the first examining the pattern of RH and FP service utilization at the CHS and in other health facilities in the context of change in the healthcare system in Vietnam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="459" pm="."><plain>With basic RH services available from a range of health facilities, women in Vietnam, especially those in urbanized areas, have been given a range of alternatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="460" pm="."><plain>However, state services continue to dominate, though private services are playing a significant role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="461" pm="."><plain>In general, the local CHS appears to be the most frequently used health facility for FP, ANC, and gynecological examination services, all free or heavily subsidized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="462" pm="."><plain>Hospitals dominate the provision of delivery services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="463" pm="."><plain>There were marked differentials in women's selection of service providers for ANC and delivery services between rural and urban areas. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="464" pm="."><plain>Data on behavioral RH care indicators in the selected districts were impressive with a very high proportion of married women currently using a birth control method, high rates of pregnant women having sufficient ANC and giving birth at a health facility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>These data were comparable with the national-level statistics over the past 5 years [13] that reported high national rates of contraceptive use (80%-90%), at least 3 antenatal visits in pregnant women (87%), and deliveries attended by trained health personnel (95% or higher) [14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="466" pm="."><plain>The pattern of birth control methods currently used was also keeping with the national data that reported IUD to be the most popular method applied by around 56% of married couples [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>The high levels of contraceptive use, with the local CHS as the major supplier, indicates that the model of providing FP services in Vietnam is effective, and able to meet local needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>Historically, the CHS has been serving as the primary access point for FP services under the national population and family planning program since early 1960s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>Over time, the CHS has gained a reputation for its provision of subsidized FP services, with delivery of FP services strengthened by the population collaborator network, providing women with easy access to low-cost, community-based services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the local pharmacy is also significant, diversifying the provision of condoms or other contraceptive commodities at the commune level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>The hospital and private providers appear to have a little role in the provision of IUD services and other FP commodities (i.e. condoms or pills). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>The CHS also appears to be a major provider for antenatal check-ups, particularly in the rural area, although the number of private antenatal service users was significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>This finding counters previous studies that reported lower use of primary healthcare and outpatient treatment services at CHSs compared to private clinics or hospitals [1,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>Antenatal care check-ups at the CHS are subsidized and accompanied by free pre-natal tetanus vaccination, and the CHS is proactive in inviting mothers to register for the monthly antenatal clinic when their pregnancy is confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>However, while CHSs continue to dominate the provision of ANC services, a preference for delivery in hospitals was clear in these districts, a finding consistent with rising economic status and increasing patient expectations of the health system in Vietnam [2,8,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>Living location affects the selection of ANC service providers, with rural women more likely than their urban counterparts to use the CHS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>The same differential was not seen in the choice of services relating to delivery, with women living in rural areas as likely to choose a hospital as those in the city. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>In both settings, district hospitals have become the most popular provider for this service, while the role of the local CHS has tended to diminish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Our data support earlier studies that found a low use of CHS delivery services, with most women preferring district hospital-based delivery because of the perceived better quality of services for both mothers and newborn [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>The data also support the qualitative study in these provinces that noted the 2-child population control policy has made couples more cautious about outcomes for their baby, choosing hospital-based delivery where they are more confident in provider's expertise and equipment, and life saving emergency care is readily available [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>The high use of gynecological check-up services at the local CHS was attributed in part to the national RH semi-annual campaign. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>Although this national campaign is aimed at early detection and treatment of RTIs, population-based studies conducted within the last 10 years, including one study in Thua Thien Hue, reported a prevalence of RTIs ranging from 21% to 39% among women of reproductive age [18-20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>The RTIs prevalence was found to be even higher in hospital- or clinic-based studies, though these were subject to selection bias [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>While RTIs can change overtime and vary by provinces, such high prevalence raises questions around the strategic use of CHS-based free gynecological check-ups during the national semi-annual RH campaign, with questions over the quality and efficacy of this service as an intervention strategy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>Private physicians were important providers for ANC services in both rural and urban areas, despite their uneven geographical distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>With RH private clinics mostly concentrated in urban areas, using private services not only incurred higher fees, but also travel expenses for rural women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>Yet, a significant proportion of rural women used private clinics during their latest pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>Previous studies report criticism of state facilities and a preference for reproductive healthcare provided at private clinics, though, paradoxically, these private clinics are serviced by physicians who routinely work in state health facilities [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>In the private clinics, clients may be entitled to direct access to more senior clinicians, and find staff more responsive, compared to their reception in state services [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>While CHSs maintained dominance in provision of ANC services, there was a clear upwards trend for the use of private antenatal services, consistent with trends for other health service use in Vietnam [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>In essence, the patterns of RH service provider choice were driven by socio-economic and geographic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>Women of lower socio-economic status, who were farmers, earning a lower income, having more than 2 children, and living in a rural area were more likely to use antenatal, delivery, and/or gynecological check-up services at the local CHS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with previous studies that found the poor tend to use the CHS more frequently than the rich [1,24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>Among the 2 provinces, a higher percentage of women in Thua Thien Hue reported visiting their local CHS for ANC and gynecological check up services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>This difference can be explained by the higher number of CHSs in sampled communes in Thua Thien Hue staffed by a doctor (13), compared to those in Vinh Long (10) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>In Vinh Long, 2 of 3 districts included in the survey had an accredited private RH clinic, while there were none in rural districts of Thua Thien Hue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>This was reflected in the findings that more rural women in Vinh Long used antenatal check-ups at private clinics and fewer of them used this service at the CHS compared to their counterparts in Thua Thien Hue, though in both provinces, there were low levels of delivery in private facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>This difference also indicates a shift from CHSs to private doctors for ANC services where they are locally accessible, reducing the use for services delivered through the CHS system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>The study findings should be considered in conjunction with the limitations of the research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>The sample was drawn from districts purposively selected for the intervention project, and thus not representative for the whole province. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="501" pm="."><plain>Although the percentage of women who have a current sexual partner (3%) was consistent with national data on prevalence of premarital sex among young women (5.2%), [26] the sample of unmarried women was too small for meaningful statistical analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>Data were self-reported, and may incur recall bias with regards to the history of RH service use, particularly with ANC and delivery services. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Although the CHS in this study retains significant utilization rates and constitutes an important provider of primary RH services, it is under challenge on three fronts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>The first challenge is from the significant use of private practice for ANC, where clients have direct access to higher grades of health care providers, and are willing to pay higher fees for their perceptions of better quality of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>Secondly, although the semi-annual gynecological screening continues to attract significant numbers of women with its subsidized service, its effectiveness as a population strategy is questionable, and the quality of services needs evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the preference for delivery in district hospitals over CHS is marked, and arguably, government services would do well to move towards strengthened referral services and shared care with the CHS, rather than invest in duplication of these functions at both levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>To address these challenges, the CHS system needs to be responsive to specific local needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="509" pm="."><plain>In areas with accessible alternative health services reducing the need for CHS services, rationalizing of services is needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="510" pm="."><plain>Those CHSs that attempt to function in the shadow of hospital facilities need to be protected by referral practices and clear differentiation of services to avoid unnecessary provision of routine RH care by more costly staff, in higher cost level facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="511" pm="."><plain>At the same time, efforts should be made to improve service quality at the local CHS as the economy improves and clients demonstrate growing demand for higher quality services. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="512" pm="."><plain>With the reduction in government subsidies, a responsive payment scheme must be developed at the CHS level that generates income for the sustainable provision of quality services, but retains subsidized services for the poor who continue to rely on their local CHS for basic reproductive healthcare. </plain></SENT>
