</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychological measures were collected by postal questionnaire survey from a random sample of primary care physicians in Scotland and north England. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were clinical behaviour (referral rates for lumbar spine x-rays), behavioural simulation (lumbar spine x-ray referral decisions based upon scenarios), and behavioural intention (general intention to refer for lumbar spine x-rays in patients with low back pain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Explanatory variables were the constructs within the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM), Operant Learning Theory (OLT), Implementation Intention (II), Weinstein's Stage Model termed the Precaution Adoption Process (PAP), and knowledge. </plain></SENT>

</text></SecTag></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Background </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Healthcare systems and professionals fail to deliver the quality of care to which they aspire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies internationally have observed evidence to practice gaps demonstrating that 30 to 40 percent of patients do not get treatments of proven effectiveness, and equally discouraging, up to 25 percent of patients receive unnecessary care that is potentially harmful [1-3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such evidence to practice gaps have significant adverse effects on the health and social welfare of citizens and economic productivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Lumbar spine imaging for low back pain in primary care settings is an example of an evidence to practice gap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Low back pain is an extremely common presentation in primary care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, lumbar spine imaging in patients under 50 years is of limited diagnostic benefit within primary care settings [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Globally, clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain do not recommend routine imaging of patients with low back pain [4-8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, standard lumbar spine x-rays (the most common imaging modality used by UK primary care physicians) are associated with significant ionising radiation dosage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Despite this, lumbar spine x-rays are the fourth most common x-ray request from UK primary care physicians [9], with x-ray referrals continuing at the rate of 7 per 1000 patients per year [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We conducted a trial that found that for the majority of primary care physician requests, case note review could not identify appropriate indications for referral [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The trial also observed a reduction in lumbar spine x-rays of 20 percent without apparent adverse effects following the introduction of educational messages [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recognition of evidence to practice gaps has led to increased interest in more active strategies to disseminate and implement evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Over the past two decades, a considerable body of implementation research has been developed [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This research demonstrates that dissemination and implementation interventions can be effective, but provides little information to guide the choice or optimise the components of such complex interventions in practice [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of interventions appears to vary across different clinical problems, contexts, and organizations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of potential barriers and enablers to dissemination and implementation is limited and hindered by a lack of a 'basic science' relating to determinants of professional and organizational behaviour and potential targets for intervention [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The challenge for implementation researchers is to develop and evaluate a theoretical base to support the choice and development of interventions as well as the interpretation of implementation study results [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Despite recent increased interest in the potential value of behavioural theory to predict healthcare professional behaviour, relatively few studies have assessed this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A recent review by Godin et al. explored the use of social cognitive models to better understand determinants of health care professionals' intentions and behaviours [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>They identified 72 studies that provided information on the determinants of intention, but only 16 prospective studies that provided information on the determinants of behaviour. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The current study, one part of the PRIME (PRocess modelling in ImpleMEntation research) study) [17], aimed to investigate the use of a number of psychological theories to explore factors associated with primary care physician lumbar spine x-ray referrals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Previous PRIME studies have used similar methods to explore factors associated with primary care physicians' use of antibiotics for sore throats and general dental practitioners' use of routine intra-oral x-rays and preventive fissure sealants [18-20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Variables were drawn from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [21], Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [22], Operant Learning Theory (OLT) [23] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/Home.html">http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/Home.html</ext-link>, Implementation Intentions (II) [24], Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM) [25], and Weinstein's Stage Model termed the Precaution Adoption Process (PAP) [26,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These specific theories, which are described in detail elsewhere [28], were chosen because they predict behaviour but vary in their emphasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Some focus on motivation, proposing that motivation determines behaviour, and therefore the best predictors of behaviour are factors that predict or determine motivation (e.g., TPB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Some place more emphasis on factors that are necessary to predict behaviour in people who are already motivated to change (e.g., II). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Others propose that individuals are at different stages in the progress toward behaviour change, and that predictors of behaviour may be different for individuals at different stages (e.g., PAP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The specific models used in this study were chosen for three additional reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>First, they have been rigorously evaluated with patients or with healthy individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Second, they allow us to examine the influence on clinical behaviour of perceived external factors, such as patient preferences and organisational barriers and facilitators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Third, they all explain behaviour in terms of variables that are amenable to change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify those theories and the theoretical constructs that predicted clinical behaviour, behavioural simulation (as measured by the decisions made in response to five written clinical scenarios) and behavioural intention for lumbar spine x-ray referral. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Study participants were a random sample of primary care physicians selected from a list of all such physicians in selected regions of Scotland (Grampian, Tayside, Lothian) and north England (Durham, Newcastle and South Tees) by a statistician using a list of random sampling numbers. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Theoretically-derived measures were developed following standard operationalisation protocols wherever possible [21,29-33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The cognition questions were developed from semi-structured interviews with 18 primary care physicians in Scotland and north England that lasted up to 60 minutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The interviews use standard elicitation methods and covered physicians' views and experiences about managing patients with low back pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Responses were used to create the questions measuring constructs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The target sample size of 200 was based on a recommendation by Green [35] to have a minimum of 162 subjects when undertaking multiple regression analysis with 14 predictor variables. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The internal consistency of the measures was tested using Cronbach's alpha. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>If this was less than 0.6, then questionnaire items were removed from each measure to achieve the highest Cronbach's alpha possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>For constructs with only two questions, a correlation coefficient of 0.25 was used as a cut off. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>For each of the three outcome variables, we examined the relationship between predictor and outcome variables within the structure of each of the theories individually. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Spearman's correlation (for behaviour outcome) and Pearson Correlation Coefficients (for behavioural simulation and intention outcomes) between the individual constructs and the outcome measures were calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Given the distribution of the behavioural data, we used negative binomial regression (NBR) to model the predictive ability of individual theoretical constructs and complete theories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>NBR is used to model count exhibiting over dispersion, as in the case of the behaviour outcome data in this study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The pseudo-R2 we chose to use was McFaddens' adjusted R2 because it penalizes models in the spirit of adjusted R2 in linear regression for adding more variables to a model (see Additional File 2 for further discussion). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>For the five 'perceived cause of illness' questions in the CS-SRM, responses were dichotomized into scores of five to seven (indicating agreement that the cause in question was responsible for low back pain) versus anything else (indicating disagreement). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="811" pm="."><plain>We have successfully developed and applied psychological theory-based questionnaires that have, in the context of ordering of lumbar spine x-rays in the management of patients with low back pain been able to predict two proxies for behaviour (behavioural simulation and intention) and (to a lesser extent) behaviour. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="812" pm="."><plain>Overall interpretation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="813" pm="."><plain>Low back pain is a frequent presenting problem in primary care settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="814" pm="."><plain>However, the use of x-rays in clinical management of low back pain is relatively infrequent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="815" pm="."><plain>In the theory level analysis predicting clinical behaviour, constructs relating to beliefs about consequences (SCT (risk perception) and CS-SRM (cause - poor prior medical treatment, cause - patient's own behaviour and cause-ageing, control - patient) and beliefs about capabilities (TPB (perceived behavioural control)) all significantly predicted behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="816" pm="."><plain>Looking across our two other outcome measures, there are also suggestions that beliefs about consequences (attitudes, outcome expectancies, risk perception, anticipated consequences) and beliefs about capabilities (PBC, self efficacy) may be important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="817" pm="."><plain>In addition, II predicted behavioural simulation and OLT (evidence of habitual behaviour) predicted intention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="818" pm="."><plain>The theories individually explained a significant proportion of the variance in behavioural simulation and intention, but overall were poorly predictive of behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="819" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest both beliefs about consequences and beliefs about capabilities are likely determinants of lumbar spine x-ray requests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="820" pm="."><plain>This is a correlational study, so the causative aspects of the theories and their constructs remain untested in this population; but it is promising for the utility of applying psychological theory to changing clinical behaviour that the constructs are acting as the theories expect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="821" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an intervention that specifically targets predictive elements should have the greatest likelihood of success in influencing the implementation of this evidence-based practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="822" pm="."><plain>The PRIME study has evaluated the predictive value of a range of theories across different behaviours (prescribing antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections, or URTIs, taking dental radiographs, placing preventive fissure sealants), target professional groups (primary care doctors, dentists), and contexts [17,19,20,37]; we have demonstrated that different constructs predicted different proportions of the variance in the intention and behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="823" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of how best to identify relevant theories specific to different behaviours and clinical groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="824" pm="."><plain>One option would be to undertake preliminary work to identify the key construct domains that are likely to influence the target behaviours, and use them to specify potentially relevant theories [38,39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="825" pm="."><plain>Strengths and weaknesses </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="826" pm="."><plain>Operationalising our behaviour of interest in the surveys that reflected the available behavioural data was challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="827" pm="."><plain>Our behaviour of interest was managing patients with low back pain without referral for lumbar spine x-ray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="828" pm="."><plain>However, we could only get behavioural data on the number of lumbar spine x-ray referrals ordered by primary care physicians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="829" pm="."><plain>In general, we tried to word the survey questions to correspond to the available behavioural data (e.g., 'when a patient presents with back pain, I have in mind to refer them for X-ray'). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="830" pm="."><plain>However, we found it difficult to frame some questions that corresponded to the behavioural data and clinically sensible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="831" pm="."><plain>As a result the final questionnaire, included some questions worded in terms of doing the behaviour (e.g., in general, referring patients with back pain for an X-ray would...) and some worded in terms of not doing the behaviour (e.g., without an x-ray, how confident are you in your ability to...). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="832" pm="."><plain>This raises the issue of whether doing and not doing a behaviour are two sides of the same behaviour, or whether they represent linked but alternate behaviours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="833" pm="."><plain>If the latter, the predictive ability of our survey instrument would be likely to be reduced. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="834" pm="."><plain>Operationalising the constructs with theoretical fidelity was also challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="835" pm="."><plain>A number of the models (OLT, II, CS-SRM) had not been operationalised in this way prior to the PRIME studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="836" pm="."><plain>OLT and II are usually used as intervention methods to change behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="837" pm="."><plain>However, both predicted behavioural simulation, and OLT predicted intention and behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="838" pm="."><plain>Since we undertook this study, some of the models have been adapted or enhanced, and different approaches to measurement have been developed -- for example, the post intentional action-coping planning enhancements of the TPB [40,41] and Verplanken's Self Reported Habit Index [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="839" pm="."><plain>The CS-SRM pattern of results mirrored the overall picture of beliefs about consequences and capabilities being important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="840" pm="."><plain>However, they did not predict behaviour, behavioural simulation, and intention particularly well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="841" pm="."><plain>The model has previously been used mainly to refer to an individual's perceptions of their clinical condition; we used it to measure a clinician's perception of the condition in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="842" pm="."><plain>We had difficulty operationalising this model, and further work is needed to explore the utility of this theory to predict clinician behaviour. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="843" pm="."><plain>There is a stepwise decrease in the proportion of variance across our dependent variables from intention to behavioural simulation (to behaviour) (Tables 2 and 4) as found in previous PRIME studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="844" pm="."><plain>Godin's review [16] of the predictive value of social cognitive models on professional behaviour showed a similar pattern, with social cognitive models explaining means of 13% of the variance in objectively measured behaviour (from 11 studies), 44% of self-reported behaviour (from four studies), and 59% of intention (from 72 studies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="845" pm="."><plain>Our results are each lower than Godin's average figures, but all are within the range reported by other studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="846" pm="."><plain>However, our explanation of behaviour is at the very lowest limit of the reported range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="847" pm="."><plain>In the previous PRIME studies, we have been able to explain 16% of the variance in general dental practitioners' use of dental radiographs [37] and 6% of primary care physicians prescribing of antibiotics for patients who present with an URTI [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="848" pm="."><plain>This suggests that our operationalisation of the models was likely to have been good, and raises the question of why the models did not work as well for ordering lumbar spine x-rays by primary care physicians. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="849" pm="."><plain>We can identify three potential explanations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="850" pm="."><plain>Firstly, there was poor correspondence between the behaviour specified in the survey and the measured behaviour as mentioned above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="851" pm="."><plain>This highlights the importance of clear and consistent framing of the questions and concordance with the measured behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="852" pm="."><plain>In the previous PRIME papers, the behaviours specified in the surveys and the measured behaviours were: dental radiographs (survey - use of intra-oral radiographs in patient management, data - the number of intra oral radiographs taken per course of treatment (good concordance)) [18], and antibiotics (survey - prescribing an antibiotic for patients presenting with URTIs, managing patients without an antibiotic, data - number of likely URTI relevant antibiotic prescriptions per 100 patients registered (weak concordance)) [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="853" pm="."><plain>Second, there was potentially excess observational error (noise) in our behaviour measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="854" pm="."><plain>X-ray-ordering data was chosen because it was available from routine data sources, and was therefore inexpensive to collect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="855" pm="."><plain>Low back pain was chosen because it was more likely that a request for an investigation would be attributed to the primary care doctor who issued it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="856" pm="."><plain>Despite this, anecdotally we believe that there may be errors in the attribution of x-rays to doctors, with radiology departments reporting that requests could be reported to the correct practice but attributed to the wrong primary care doctor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="857" pm="."><plain>In addition, we attempted to standardise our behaviour by the number of patients registered with the primary care doctor to reflect differences in workloads of the participating primary care doctors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="858" pm="."><plain>We only had data on the total number of patients and number of primary care doctors in each practice, and so calculated an average list size per primary care doctor within each practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="859" pm="."><plain>This is a relatively crude standardisation approach that does not take account of likely variations of workload within practices (not all primary care doctors in the same practice will have the same workload) and variations in presentation of the target condition (not all primary care doctors will have same rate of presentation of low back pain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="860" pm="."><plain>In the previous PRIME studies, these issues were likely to have been more problematic in the antibiotic study rather than the fissure sealant study (where data were abstracted from a claims database). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="861" pm="."><plain>These issues reflect some of the challenges of using routine data to measure behaviour relating to the level of clinical detail available (we could not estimate the number of patients each primary care doctor saw presenting with back pain) and problems of attribution of clinical actions to specific primary care doctors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="862" pm="."><plain>In future studies of this kind, it will be important to invest more in the measurement of the behavioural data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="863" pm="."><plain>These issues are likely to be less problematic in population-based large administrative database facilities where there may be detailed understanding of the content of the available data and their limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="864" pm="."><plain>Alternatively it could be possible to collect behavioural data directly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="865" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, we used a different analytical approach to analyse the behavioural data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="866" pm="."><plain>Previous PRIME studies have used multiple regression analyses and used the adjusted R2 statistic from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to quantify the proportion of variance explained by the models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="867" pm="."><plain>In the current study, when we conducted multiple regression analyses of behavioural simulation and intention, we observed similar magnitude R2 statistics for behavioural simulation and intention models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="868" pm="."><plain>However given the distribution of the lumbar spine x-ray data, we had to use negative binomial regression for the behavioural analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="869" pm="."><plain>A direct equivalent to the adjusted R2 statistic does not exist for negative binomial regression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="870" pm="."><plain>There are several pseudo R2 statistics that mimic OLS R2 in the sense that they can range over the scale 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a better fit of models to data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="871" pm="."><plain>We present the results for various goodness to fit models that suggest that, in general, the resulting models overall were poorly predictive of the behavioural data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="872" pm="."><plain>However these pseudo R2 values cannot be used to compare the performance of competing theoretical models across different data sets, making comparisons of proportion variation explained with previous PRIME study surveys qualitative only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="873" pm="."><plain>To explore the likely comparability of these results with previous PRIME studies, we undertook an OLS regression of square root transformed behavioural data and observed an R2 statistic of 0.05, which is at the lower end of the observed R2 statistics from previous PRIME studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="874" pm="."><plain>Together, we believe these data suggest that the models may be performing similarly to those in previous PRIME studies and the analytical approach required due to the negative binomial distribution is obscuring this. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="875" pm="."><plain>Our final response rate was not high compared to what would be expected for a postal questionnaire survey to healthcare professionals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="876" pm="."><plain>Following the report by Cummings et al. that up to 1995, response rates of surveys of healthcare professionals remained constant at approximately 60% [43], Cook et al. demonstrated that by 2005 response rates in surveys of healthcare professionals had slightly declined to an average of 57.5% [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="877" pm="."><plain>Given this, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias in respondents and should be cautious about generalising from our respondents to the population of UK primary care physicians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="878" pm="."><plain>However, this may be less of an issue at this exploratory stage of using these methods, as the purpose of the study was theory testing and an exploration of the predictive ability of theories to explain variations in behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="879" pm="."><plain>Our aim was not to generate data that was representative, but to receive our pre-specified number of responses from a population who had a range of behaviour, reported a range of behavioural simulation and intention, and who reported a range of cognitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="880" pm="."><plain>The study achieved this aim. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="882" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that psychological models may be useful in understanding and predicting clinical behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="883" pm="."><plain>Taking a theory-based approach enables the creation of a replicable methodology for identifying factors that predict clinical behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="884" pm="."><plain>However, there remain conceptual challenges in operationalising a number of the models and a range of methodological challenges in terms of instrument development and measurement of behaviour that have to be surmounted before these methods could be regarded as routine. </plain></SENT>
