<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of aphids and other arthropod pests on plants can be affected by light quality [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>UV-B radiation, for example, increases the biosynthesis of protective phenolic compounds like kaempferol and quercetin glycosides in plants [3–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the concentration of specific glucosinolates in Brassica oleracea var. italica P. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>(Brassicaceae; broccoli) can be increased by treatment with UV-B or UV-A radiation [5–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This light-induced increase in plant metabolites results from the stimulation of specific photoreceptors followed by the activation of a signal transduction chain and the triggering of transcription factors and genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Expression of these genes shifts the composition of metabolites in the plant, and changes in specific secondary plant metabolites can enhance or decrease the susceptibility to certain herbivorous insects [2, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition to UV-B and UV-A, other light qualities, e.g., blue, green, and red, may also induce the biosynthesis of certain plant metabolites such as flavonoids and glucosinolates and alter the resistance of the plant [8–13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With the increasing development of LED technology and its use in horticultural production systems in protected environments, plant producers are now able to create specific light scenarios for influencing plant growth and quality and also plant metabolites so as to protect plants against herbivorous insects [14–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The application of LED-generated narrow-bandwidth light of different quality is a promising approach for enhancing the production of secondary metabolites in plants [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The effect of LED light treatments on plants is receiving increasing attention from researchers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Additional green light generated with LEDs did not influence the growth of Cucumis sativus L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>(Cucurbitaceae; cucumber seedlings) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In contrast, green LED light promoted growth of Lactuca sativa L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>(Asteraceae; lettuce) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Increases in blue light intensity enhanced the chlorophyll content per leaf area and photosynthetic rate in cucumber, resulting in improved primary plant metabolism and growth [17, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>LED lighting can also affect concentration of secondary plant metabolites. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>By altering plant metabolites, light can affect the behavior, performance, and development of herbivorous insects [2, 7, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Treatment with UV-B increased the concentrations of kaempferol glycosides and specific glucosinolates in broccoli plants, and feeding on these plants reduced the fecundity of the specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae Linnaeus but improved the performance of the generalist aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer (both Hemiptera: Aphididae) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Moreover, B. brassicae preferred to colonize broccoli plants grown under ambient UV conditions than under low-UV conditions in open, plastic tunnels equipped with UV-blocking vs. UV-transmitting films but B. brassicae population growth was reduced on plants grown under high-UV conditions [22–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This indicates that insect reactions to light treatments can be insect-specific. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that different LED-generated light qualities (ranging from UV-A to green) can alter the growth as well as the metabolic composition (flavonoids and glucosinolates) of Brassica oleracea var. italic (broccoli) plants and indirectly influence (via plant metabolites) the choice of host plant and performance of the cabbage aphid B. brassicae. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effects of different narrow-bandwidths of light on the growth of broccoli plants, on the concentrations of glucosinolates and flavonol glycosides in the plants, and on the interaction between the plants and the aphid B. brassicae, which is a specialized herbivore of Brassica spp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested in comparing the effects of short-wavelength light (UV-A) with longer PAR wavelength light (violet, blue, and green). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Broccoli plants grown under additional green light (50 μmol m-2 s-1) in our study were significantly taller than plants grown under the control light or under UV-A, violet, or blue light treatments (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Plant responses to green light are typically low-light responses that may help plants grow when under foliage or when near other plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>From a plant perspective, it makes sense to grow taller so as to avoid shade in areas with higher green light intensities [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Johkan et al. [18] reported that lettuce plant growth was increased under additional high-intensity green LED light (300 μmol m-2 s-1) with a peak wavelength of 510 nm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In the current study, broccoli plant leaf number and dry weight were unaffected by the light treatments (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Fan et al. [35], in contrast, found that Chinese cabbage plants weighed more and were shorter when treated with blue 460 nm LED light than with green 520 nm LED light with intensities of 150 μmol m-2 s-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>These differences between studies demonstrate that the effect of light of different wavelengths can be species-specific. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The LED light treatments had no indirect effect via secondary metabolite composition of the broccoli plant on the performance (adult weight, fecundity, and developmental time) of B. brassicae (Fig 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>However, shorter wavelengths with a higher amount of energy such as UV-B treatments have been previously shown to increase the concentrations of kaempferol glycosides and indole glucosinolates (3-indolylmethyl and 4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl) and to reduce the fecundity of B. brassicae on broccoli plants [6, 22, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In another study, UV-A treatments reduced the reproduction of soybean aphids [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Illumination of Brussels sprout plants with additional LED-generated UV-A radiation (259 kJ m-2 d-1) in a greenhouse increased the concentrations of 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate in the plants and reduced the fecundity of B. brassicae relative to blue light-treated plants [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>In the latter study, 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate concentrations were as high as 2304 μg g-1 d.w. in UV-A treated Brussels sprout plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The concentrations in the latter study were clearly higher than those in the broccoli plants (207 μg g-1 d.w.) that were treated with additional UV-A radiation in a climate-chamber in the present study (Fig 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This difference might be explained by a plant species-specific difference in sensitivity to UV-A treatments or to a dose-response reaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Although some defense compounds reacted, i.e., quercetin-3-O-hydroxyferuloyl-sinapoyl-triglucoside-7-O-diglucoside and mono-acylated triglycosides of kaempferol were increased by violet light, the concentrations in the present study were quite low and did not significantly affect aphid performance (Figs 6 and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Broccoli plants in a previous study that were grown under UV-B treatments contained up to 4100 μg g-1 d.w. of single kaempferol glycosides such as kaempferol-3-O-caffeoyl-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside [6], while broccoli plants treated with longer wavelength in the present study contained low concentrations (&lt; 100 μg g-1 d.w.) of all specific kaempferol glycosides even though the illumination times, overall light intensities, and plant stages were the same in both studies (Fig 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In experiments with Chinese cabbage, Kim et al. [11] also detected very low concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol glycosides (&lt; 10 μg g-1 d.w.) after 12 days of illumination with blue, red, or white LEDs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Plant choice by aphids was indirectly affected by the light treatments in the present study, i.e., significantly more aphids selected plants that had been grown with additional blue light rather than with control light (Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>There was also a non-statistically significant tendency for aphids to prefer plants that had been grown with additional green light rather than with control light, but the aphids showed no preference for plants that had been grown with additional UV-A or violet light (Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This behavior could only be partly explained by increasing amounts of secondary plant metabolites, because the only enhanced compound was 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate, which had significantly higher concentrations in plants exposed to UV-A than in plants exposed to blue and violet light treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The green peach aphid Myzus persicae, on the other hand, preferred Chinese cabbage plants with reduced concentrations of glucosinolates, indicating that secondary plant metabolites could affect host selection by aphids [38]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In the choice experiment in the current study, the aphids were able to switch between the two plants after unsuccessful probing on one plant or after determining that one plant was a better nutrient source than the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Probing by the aphid Sitobion avenae was reduced on plants that were treated with enhanced UV-B irradiation as indicated by smaller number of phloem phase, shorter phloem ingestion, and fewer aphids reaching the sustained phloem ingestion phase [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Host selection by aphids could also be influenced by host volatiles [40] or by visual cues [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>To separate between visual or olfactory cues and probing behavior-induced differences in host selection, it would be helpful to conduct olfactory experiments in which aphids did not directly contact the plant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Blue light can increase the chlorophyll content per leaf area and the photosynthetic rate, resulting in better primary plant metabolism [17, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This could cause host plants to be more attractive to aphids, at least after the initial probing by the aphids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Future studies on host choice by aphids should include the alteration of primary metabolites in the phloem sap. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The light quality of the background spectra can also modify the metabolic composition of a plant, and high PAR intensities with a high amount of blue light can improve photosynthetic performance and acclimatization to and recovery from UV irradiation [19, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The background spectrum contained more blue light but less red light in the current study (Fig 1) than in our previous study [6], although the light intensity was the same (100 µmol m-2 s-1 PAR) in both studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The induction of secondary metabolites by PAR may provide a basic level of UV protection that is optimized and increased by UV-B and UV-A radiation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of secondary plant metabolites (such as glucosinolates and flavonol glycosides) in broccoli plants grown in a climate chamber with specific UV-B, UV-A, and violet light treatments were greater with more red light in the background spectrum [6] than with more blue light in the background spectrum (as in the current study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>This could partially explain the differences in aphid performance between these two studies, but the effect of the background spectrum was not investigated in detail in either study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Shorter wavelength (UV-A) light as well as longer PAR wavelength (violet to green) light in combination with a blue background spectrum were unable to sufficiently alter the concentrations of glucosinolates and flavonol glycosides so as to reduce the performance of B. brassicae on broccoli plants in the present study. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that similar intensities of narrow-bandwidth light treatments in addition to PAR can alter the concentration of specific secondary metabolites in broccoli plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of flavonol glycosides and glucosinolates in this study were quite low and did not affect the performance of the specialized aphid B. brassicae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Host choice by B. brassicae was indirectly influenced by the narrow-bandwidth light treatments in that the aphid preferred blue light-illuminated plants (but not UV-A-, violet-, or green-illuminated plants) to control plants. </plain></SENT>
