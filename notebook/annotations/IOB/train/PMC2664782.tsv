In	O

we	O
describe	O
a	O

The	O
OBPI	O
ARMS	O

will	O
require	O

Improvement	O

Based	O
on	O
our	O
experience	O

we	O
recommend	O
that	O
ARMS	O

undergo	O
staged	O
surgical	O
correction	O
of	O
the	O
medial	O
rotation	O
contracture	O

by	O
derotational	O
radial	O

to	O
correct	O
the	O
supination	O
of	O
the	O

In	O
our	O

we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

by	O
triangle	O

not	O
only	O
returned	O
the	O

to	O
a	O
neutral	O

also	O
revealed	O
the	O
true	O
extent	O

within	O
the	O

In	O
addition	O

it	O
has	O

that	O
correction	O
of	O
the	O
medial	O
rotation	O

the	O

Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
medial	O
rotation	O
of	O
the	O
arm	O
should	O
be	O
alleviated	O
before	O
the	O
