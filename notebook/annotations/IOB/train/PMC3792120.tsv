is	O
unclear	O
and	O
may	O

Though	O
the	O

must	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O

context	O
of	O
the	O
various	O
limitations	O
and	O
potential	O

within	O
the	O

The	O
most	O
obvious	O
harm	O
risk	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
clinical	O
outcomes	O
is	O
believed	O
to	O
result	O
from	O
situations	O
where	O
the	O
patient	O
fails	O
to	O
request	O
an	O
appointment	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
relapse	O
or	O
escalation	O
of	O
their	O
condition	O
and	O
therefore	O
symptoms	O
become	O
worse	O
and	O
possibly	O
critical	O
.	O

This	O
may	O
increasingly	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
where	O
PIC	O
interventions	O
do	O
not	O
include	O
a	O
‘	O
safety	O
-	O
net	O
’	O
appointment	O
system	O
or	O
where	O
clinicians	O
are	O
unable	O
to	O
select	O
‘	O
appropriate	O
’	O
patients	O
for	O
the	O
PIC	O
pathway	O
.	O

A	O
less	O
apparent	O
harm	O
risk	O
may	O
occur	O
if	O
during	O
a	O
“	O
routine	O
”	O
traditional	O
appointment	O
there	O
are	O
elements	O
of	O
preventative	O
healthcare	O
or	O
patient	O
education	O
that	O
occur	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
not	O
covered	O
during	O
an	O
“	O
urgent	O
”	O
PIC	O
appointment	O
.	O

This	O
risk	O
can	O
probably	O
be	O
circumvented	O
by	O
incorporating	O
an	O
appropriate	O
check	O
list	O
into	O
a	O
safety	O
net	O
appointment	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
no	O
statistically	O
significant	O
harms	O
reported	O
by	O
any	O
study	O

From	O
these	O

it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
approximately	O
18	O
