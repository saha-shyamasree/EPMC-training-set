We	O
approached	O
this	O

from	O
an	O
extra	O

welfarist	O
,	O
societal	O
and	O
social	O
model	O

perspective	O
,	O
underpinned	O
by	O
principles	O
of	O
disability	O
equality	O
and	O
utility	O
theory	O
.	O

The	O
social	O
model	O
of	O
disability	O
postulates	O
that	O
people	O
with	O
impairments	O
become	O
disabled	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
social	O
oppression	O
and	O
discrimination	O
.	O

Disability	O
is	O
therefore	O
defined	O
as	O
being	O
a	O
direct	O
result	O
of	O
societal	O
barriers	O
to	O
participation	O
and	O
independence	O
imposed	O
on	O
people	O
with	O

[	O

].	O

This	O
theoretical	O
position	O
necessitated	O
a	O
broader	O
view	O
of	O
disability	O
and	O
impairment	O
in	O
this	O
study	O
,	O
looking	O
beyond	O
traditional	O
medical	O
definitions	O
of	O
health	O
and	O
disability	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
we	O
focussed	O
on	O
a	O
wide	O
range	O
of	O
topics	O
in	O
the	O
interviews	O
and	O
analyses	O
.	O

Utility	O
theory	O
underpins	O
popular	O
methods	O
of	O
economic	O
evaluation	O
in	O
healthcare	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
QALYs	O
.	O

Although	O
utility	O
cannot	O
be	O
derived	O
directly	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
rank	O
different	O
health	O
states	O
in	O
order	O
of	O
societal	O
preference	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
acceptable	O
cost	O
of	O
a	O
healthcare	O
service	O
or	O
intervention	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
marginal	O
utility	O
gains	O
it	O
provides	O
.	O

Extra	O

welfarism	O
is	O
a	O
normative	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
analysis	O
of	O
health	O
and	O

,	O
which	O
includes	O
outcomes	O
such	O
as	O
individual	O
utility	O
,	O
happiness	O
,	O
social	O
interaction	O
and	O
pain	O
.	O

This	O
approach	O
is	O
relevant	O
to	O
health	O
as	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
public	O

reflects	O
the	O
need	O

the	O
