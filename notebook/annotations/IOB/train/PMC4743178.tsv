that	O

a	O

Such	O

lack	O
of	O
a	O

and	O
the	O

of	O

These	O
difficulties	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
in	O
part	O
,	O
explained	O
by	O
student	O
expectations	O
for	O
traditional	O
patient	O

that	O
is	O

when	O

In	O

The	O

be	O
,	O

conclude	O
that	O
either	O

is	O
futile	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
seemingly	O
irresolvable	O
communication	O
challenges	O
or	O
to	O
infer	O
that	O
the	O
resident	O
is	O
clinically	O
stable	O
thereby	O
apparently	O
contradicting	O
the	O
appropriateness	O
of	O
conducting	O
an	O

Researchers	O
have	O
previously	O

that	O

encountered	O

that	O
they	O

Despite	O
these	O

there	O
is	O
evidence	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O

explains	O
negative	O
attitudes	O
among	O
medical	O
students	O
towards	O

suggests	O

conceptualising	O
the	O
aged	O

environment	O
as	O
an	O
appropriate	O
setting	O
for	O

due	O

the	O
