The	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
study	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
changing	O
the	O
GH	B-GP
dose	O
was	O
examined	O
concerning	O
memory	O
and	O
wellbeing	O
,	O
separately	O
in	O
females	O
and	O
males	O

In	O

the	O
effect	O

of	O
the	O
results	O
for	O
memory	O
and	O
vigor	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
high	O

indicating	O
that	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O

the	O

are	O
quite	O
substantial	O
and	O
may	O
be	O

have	O
clinical	O
significance	O

A	O
limitation	O
of	O
the	O
study	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
distinction	O
between	O
males	O

resulted	O
in	O
quite	O
small	O
sample	O

with	O
a	O

Therefore	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
possible	O
that	O
more	O

in	O

Next	O

an	O

the	O

in	O

when	O

We	O

that	O
in	O
future	O
research	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
GH	B-GP
treatment	O
on	O
memory	O

Conclusions	O

The	O
present	O
results	O
indicate	O
that	O
changing	O
the	O
regular	O
GH	B-GP
dose	O
may	O
have	O
a	O
considerable	O
impact	O
on	O
psychological	O
functioning	O
of	O
female	O
patients	O
with	O
GH	B-DS
deficiency	I-DS
.	O

As	O
could	O
be	O
expected	O
,	O
lowering	O
the	O
dose	O
can	O
result	O
in	O
decreased	O
vigor	O
,	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
associated	O
with	O
a	O
deteriorated	O
sleep	O
quality	O
.	O

Remarkably	O
,	O
a	O
lower	O
dose	O
in	O
females	O
seems	O
to	O
improve	O
prefrontal	O
memory	O
functions	O
.	O

This	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
a	O
maintenance	O
dose	O
too	O
high	O
for	O
optimal	O
cognitive	O
functioning	O
.	O

Taking	O
these	O
differential	O
effects	O
on	O
cognition	O
and	O
mood	O
into	O
account	O
,	O
the	O
adjustment	O
of	O
GH	B-GP
dose	O
in	O
female	O
patients	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
narrow	O
window	O
.	O

A	O
dose	O
too	O
high	O
may	O
impair	O
prefrontal	O
cognitive	O
functioning	O
,	O
while	O
a	O
dose	O
too	O
low	O
may	O
result	O
in	O
decreased	O
vigor	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
the	O
present	O
results	O
suggest	O
that	O
a	O
“	O
fine	O
-	O
tuned	O
”	O
intermediate	O
dose	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
option	O
for	O
maintaining	O
an	O
optimal	O
mental	O
status	O
in	O
female	O
patients	O
