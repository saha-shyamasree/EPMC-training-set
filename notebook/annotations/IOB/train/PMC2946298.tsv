prevalence	O
and	O
trends	O

HIV	B-OG
prevalence	O
has	O
declined	O
since	O
2002	O
in	O
urban	O
clinics	O
but	O
remained	O
stable	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
clinics	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
the	O
difference	O
in	O
prevalence	O
between	O
urban	O
and	O
rural	O
areas	O
has	O
diminished	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
geography	O
of	O
HIV	B-DS
infection	I-DS
appears	O
to	O
be	O
changing	O
,	O
the	O
patterns	O
of	O
syphilis	B-DS
infection	I-DS
are	O
more	O
stable	O
and	O
rural	O
areas	O
are	O
still	O
worst	O
affected	O
.	O

Data	O
from	O
the	O
Kisesa	O
community	O
cohort	O
in	O
Magu	O
district	O
confirm	O
the	O
diminishing	O
difference	O
between	O
urban	O
and	O
rural	O
areas	O
and	O
show	O
that	O
incidence	O
is	O
increasing	O
in	O
the	O
rural	O
parts	O
of	O
Kisesa	O
ward	O
whilst	O
decreasing	O
elsewhere	O
[	O

].	O

Comparison	O
with	O
other	O
estimates	O
showed	O
that	O
ANC	O
data	O
provide	O
robust	O
estimates	O
of	O
prevalence	O
among	O
women	O
in	O
the	O
population	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
and	O
highlighted	O
that	O
the	O
AIS	O
is	O
inadequate	O
for	O
understanding	O
regional	O
prevalence	O
trends	O
.	O

Estimated	O
prevalence	O
among	O
pregnant	O
women	O
from	O
Kisesa	O
ward	O
was	O
higher	O
in	O
the	O
ANC	O
survey	O
than	O
the	O
community	O
sero	O
-	O
surveys	O
.	O

This	O
may	O
be	O
because	O
women	O
at	O
ANC	O
were	O
different	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
participated	O
in	O
the	O
sero	O
-	O
survey	O
;	O
comparison	O
of	O
key	O
characteristics	O
showed	O
that	O
women	O
from	O
Kisesa	O
ward	O
and	O
interviewed	O
in	O
ANC	O
were	O
younger	O
,	O
more	O
educated	O
and	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
primagravidae	O
than	O
women	O
interviewed	O
in	O
the	O
2007	O
sero	O
survey	O
.	O

These	O
differences	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
lower	O
ANC	O
prevalence	O
relative	O
to	O
the	O
sero	O
-	O
survey	O
,	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
observed	O
.	O

Another	O
explanation	O
for	O
the	O
difference	O
is	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
ANC	O
serving	O
Kisesa	O
women	O
offered	O
VCT	O
so	O
all	O
HIV	B-OG
testing	O
was	O
anonymous	O
in	O
2006	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
four	O
clinics	O
that	O
served	O
Kisesa	O
residents	O
did	O
not	O
offer	O
syphilis	B-DS
testing	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
HIV	B-OG
data	O
for	O
25	O
%	O
of	O
the	O
Kisesa	O

If	O
the	O
women	O
who	O
were	O
not	O

were	O
predominantly	O
negative	O

the	O

would	O
be	O
similar	O
to	O
that	O

Most	O

)	O
were	O
interviewed	O
at	O
one	O
of	O

It	O

that	O
these	O

in	O
many	O

for	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
test	O
65	O
