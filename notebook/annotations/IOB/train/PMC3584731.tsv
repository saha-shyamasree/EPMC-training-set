The	O
principles	O
defining	O
the	O
QoL	O

Principles	O
in	O
Palliative	O

may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O

because	O

way	O
that	O
respects	O
people	O

with	O

These	O
principles	O
could	O
ensure	O
that	O

have	O
recognized	O

to	O

We	O
started	O
developing	O
the	O
QoL	O
Assessment	O
Principles	O
in	O
Palliative	O
Care	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
previously	O
considered	O
,	O
by	O
identifying	O
both	O
the	O
theoretical	O
basis	O
and	O
the	O
key	O
components	O
using	O
the	O
MRC	O
framework	O
approach	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
MRC	O
framework	O
approach	O
here	O
applied	O
gives	O
strength	O
to	O
this	O
development	O
stage	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
steps	O
,	O
the	O
paucity	O
of	O

in	O
including	O
each	O
component	O
in	O
the	O
QoL	O
Assessment	O
Principles	O
in	O
Palliative	O
Care	O
may	O
represent	O
a	O
limit	O
for	O
this	O
first	O
stage	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
that	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O

Conclusion	O

We	O
reckon	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
some	O
good	O
claims	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
when	O
looking	O
at	O
QoL	O
assessment	O
in	O
palliative	O
care	O
.	O

Our	O
findings	O
may	O
contribute	O
to	O
answering	O
the	O
initial	O
question	O
we	O
included	O
in	O
the	O
title	O
of	O
this	O
paper	O
and	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
starting	O
point	O
for	O
further	O
research	O
aimed	O
at	O
defining	O
a	O
framework	O
to	O
develop	O
and	O
evaluate	O
clinical	O
interventions	O
focused	O
on	O
QoL	O
assessment	O
in	O
palliative	O
care	O
.	O

Although	O
this	O
study	O
provides	O
a	O
new	O
insight	O
on	O
clinical	O
interventions	O
focused	O
on	O
QoL	O
assessment	O
in	O
palliative	O
care	O
practice	O
,	O
our	O
findings	O
are	O
based	O
on	O
intuitions	O
,	O
reflections	O
and	O
experiences	O
of	O
the	O
study	O
group	O
members	O
.	O

Further	O
studies	O
are	O
needed	O
to	O
identify	O
the	O
extent	O
to	O
which	O
a	O
broader	O
group	O
of	O
palliative	O
care	O
experts	O
agree	O
on	O
appropriateness	O
and	O
completeness	O
of	O
the	O
principles	O
described	O
in	O
the	O
QoL	O
Assessment	O
Principles	O
in	O
Palliative	O
Care	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
these	O
proposed	O
principles	O
could	O
benefit	O
from	O
a	O
consultation	O
through	O
a	O
Delphi	O
