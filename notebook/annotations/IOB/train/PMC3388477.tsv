The	O

Role	O

Psychological	B-DS

in	O
IBD	B-DS

A	O
belief	O
in	O
the	O
relevance	O
of	O
psychological	O
factors	O
to	O
IBD	B-DS
is	O
not	O
new	O
.	O

Historically	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
first	O
in	O
the	O
1930s	O
that	O
gastroenterologists	O
and	O
psychiatrists	O
suggested	O
that	O
emotional	O
life	O
events	O
and	O
experiences	O
are	O
likely	O
related	O
to	O
exacerbation	O
of	O
intestinal	O
symptoms	O
[	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
IBD	B-DS
was	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
psychosomatic	B-DS
disease	I-DS
,	O
and	O
its	O
relation	O
to	O
stress	O
and	O
other	O
psychological	O
factors	O
was	O
thought	O
so	O
strong	O
that	O
researchers	O
felt	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
use	O
any	O
control	O
group	O
in	O
their	O
studies	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
decades	O
later	O
,	O
this	O
finding	O
was	O
questioned	O
mostly	O
due	O
to	O
methodological	O
weaknesses	O
and	O
uncontrolled	O
studies	O
published	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
while	O
IBD	B-DS
was	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O
organic	O
disease	O
,	O
and	O
psychological	O
influences	O
were	O
discounted	O
as	O
contributing	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
further	O
anecdotal	O
evidence	O
and	O
clinical	O
observations	O
indicated	O
that	O
stressful	O
experiences	O
could	O
adversely	O
affect	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
IBD	B-DS
.	O

Indeed	O
many	O
review	O
articles	O
have	O
now	O
emphasized	O
the	O
relationship	O
between	O
stress	O
and	O
IBD	B-DS
[	O
6	O
–	O
10	O
],	O
concluding	O
that	O
confusions	O
and	O
controversies	O
in	O
published	O
reports	O
were	O
partly	O
due	O
to	O
differences	O
in	O
definitions	O
of	O
stress	O
(	O
e	O

g	O
.,	O
stressful	O
life	O

or	O
hassles	O
,	O
daily	O
stress	O
)	O
and	O
partly	O
due	O
to	O
inclusion	O
of	O
mixed	O
groups	O
of	O
patients	O
(	O
CD	B-DS
versus	O
UC	B-DS
)	O
and	O
/	O
or	O
mixed	O

(	O
active	O

inactive	O

[	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
major	O
trends	O
in	O
recent	O
studies	O
were	O
to	O
differentiate	O
between	O
CD	B-DS
and	O
UC	B-DS
patients	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
utilize	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
perceived	O
stress	O
,	O
which	O
emphasizes	O
on	O
individual	O
'	O
s	O
subjective	O
perception	O
of	O
stress	O
and	O
his	O
/	O
her	O
emotional	O
response	O
to	O
it	O
[	O
11	O
].	O

These	O
trends	O
have	O
contributed	O
to	O
resolving	O
controversies	O
,	O
and	O
illuminating	O
the	O
role	O
of	O
psychological	B-DS
stress	I-DS
in	O
IBD	B-DS
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
role	O
of	O
stress	O
in	O
the	O
onset	O
of	O
IBD	B-DS
has	O
not	O
been	O
established	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
stress	O
is	O
a	O
triggering	O
and	O
exacerbating	O
factor	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
course	O
and	O
symptoms	O
of	O
IBD	B-DS
[	O

,	O
10	O

Indeed	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
determinants	O
of	O
disease	O
relapse	O
[	O
12	O

14	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
discordant	O
reports	O
about	O
a	O
relation	O
between	O
