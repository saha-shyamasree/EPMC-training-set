we	O

less	O

in	O
clinical	O
practice	O
in	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
situations	O
requiring	O
emergency	O
ventilation	O
application	O
would	O
occur	O
after	O
UAO	B-DS
developed	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
several	O
limitations	O
to	O
this	O
study	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
used	O
head	O
straps	O
with	O
both	O
the	O
nasal	O
mask	O
and	O
face	O
mask	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
bias	O
introduced	O
by	O
the	O
operator	O
’	O
s	O
technique	O
of	O
mask	O
holding	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
downward	O
displacement	O
of	O
the	O
chin	O
by	O
the	O
head	O
strap	O
in	O
patients	O
wearing	O
the	O
face	O
masks	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
the	O
mandibular	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
FmCPAP	O
group	O
was	O
different	O
from	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
nCPAP	O
group	O
.	O

We	O
continually	O
observed	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
head	O
and	O
mandible	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
head	O
stayed	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
position	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
process	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
observe	O
the	O
mandible	O
being	O
pushed	O
down	O
after	O
induction	O
of	O
anesthesia	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
we	O
cannot	O
find	O
any	O
documentation	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
regular	O
concern	O
during	O
full	O
face	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
previous	O
study	O
[	O
14	O
],	O
we	O
used	O
head	O
straps	O
for	O
both	O
nasal	O
and	O
oral	O
mask	O
application	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
head	O
strap	O
for	O
oral	O
mask	O
remained	O
in	O
place	O
during	O
nasal	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
,	O
nasal	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
effective	O
than	O
combined	O
nasal	O
and	O
oral	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
.	O

This	O
indicated	O
that	O
the	O
head	O
strap	O
for	O
face	O
mask	O
did	O
not	O
markedly	O
affect	O
airway	O
collapsibility	O
.	O

Second	O
,	O
we	O
determined	O
effectiveness	O
of	O
ventilation	O
with	O
a	O
head	O
strap	O
holding	O
the	O
nasal	O
and	O
full	O
face	O
mask	O
rather	O
than	O
testing	O
hand	O
-	O
holding	O
the	O
masks	O
.	O

The	O
nasal	O
mask	O
used	O
in	O
the	O
study	O
was	O
much	O
smaller	O
than	O
the	O
full	O
face	O
mask	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
holding	O
the	O
nasal	O
mask	O
should	O
be	O
much	O
easier	O
than	O
the	O
full	O
face	O
mask	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
because	O
application	O
of	O
the	O
nasal	O
mask	O
is	O
on	O
a	O
rigid	O
plane	O
of	O
the	O
upper	O
jaw	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
obtain	O
an	O
adequate	O
mask	O
seal	O
.	O

Third	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
control	O
for	O
the	O
pharyngeal	O
dilator	O
muscle	O
activities	O
during	O
this	O
study	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
depth	O
of	O
sedation	O
constant	O
by	O
using	O
integrated	O
electroencephalography	O
.	O

Since	O
we	O
conducted	O
a	O
randomized	O
controlled	O
study	O
,	O
we	O
assumed	O
that	O
effects	O
of	O
pharyngeal	O
dilator	O
muscle	O
activities	O
were	O
equally	O
affected	O
in	O
both	O
groups	O
and	O
this	O
would	O
not	O
affect	O
outcome	O
.	O

Fourth	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
larger	O
air	O
leaks	O
with	O
nCPAP	O
than	O
with	O
FmCPAP	O
.	O

In	O
clinical	O
practice	O
,	O
the	O
air	O
leak	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
during	O
nCPAP	O
may	O
be	O
challenging	O
because	O
maximal	O
fresh	O
gas	O
flow	O
is	O
limited	O
with	O
anesthesia	O
machines	O
and	O
during	O
field	O
emergency	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
leaking	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
can	O
be	O
eliminated	O
with	O
mouth	O
closure	O
.	O

Fifth	O
,	O
we	O
evaluated	O
the	O
effectiveness	O
of	O
ventilation	O
in	O
a	O
suboptimized	O
airway	O
condition	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
compare	O
the	O
two	O
approaches	O
during	O
an	O
optimized	O
airway	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
nCPAP	O
is	O
superior	O
to	O
FmCPAP	O
when	O
the	O
airway	O
is	O
optimized	O
.	O

Sixth	O
,	O
the	O
ETCO2	O

PIP	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
calculate	O
sample	O
size	O
based	O
upon	O
data	O
from	O
our	O
previous	O
study	O
[	O
14	O
].	O

However	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
large	O
air	O
leaks	O
during	O
nCPAP	O
,	O
ETCO2	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
subjects	O
in	O
this	O
group	O
was	O
zero	O
or	O
close	O
to	O
zero	O
.	O

These	O
subjects	O
were	O
adequately	O
ventilated	O
as	O
evidenced	O
by	O
plethysmograph	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
unable	O
to	O
use	O
ETCO2	O
/	O
PIP	O
as	O
our	O
primary	O
outcome	O
variable	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
because	O
this	O
study	O
was	O
performed	O
in	O
healthy	O
subjects	O
with	O
unknown	O
risk	O
of	O
UAO	B-DS
,	O
it	O
is	O
unclear	O
whether	O
our	O
results	O
are	O
applicable	O
to	O
subjects	O
with	O
UAO	B-DS
or	O
in	O
emergency	O
mask	O
ventilation	O
.	O

Conclusions	O

nCPAP	O
was	O
more	O
effective	O
in	O
maintaining	O
upper	O
airway	O
patency	O
in	O
unconscious	O
subjects	O
and	O
produced	O
more	O
effective	O
tidal	O
volume	O
than	O
FmCPAP	O
.	O

Application	O
of	O
nCPAP	O
even	O
after	O
UAO	B-DS
developed	O
was	O
more	O
effective	O
than	O
FmCPAP	O
and	O
generated	O
nearly	O
100	O
%	O
effective	O
tidal	O
volume	O
simply	O
by	O
closing	O
the	O
mouth	O
.	O

Further	O
clinical	O
studies	O
will	O
be	O
needed	O
to	O
confirm	O
whether	O
nCPAP	O
will	O
be	O
superior	O
to	O
FmCPAP	O
with	O
optimal	O
airway	O
