we	O

,	O
an	O
infantile	O
or	O
severe	O
form	O

a	O

form	O

The	O
infantile	O
form	O
of	O
Sengers	B-DS
syndrome	I-DS
is	O
caused	O
by	O
homozygous	O
AGK	B-GP
nonsense	O
mutations	O
and	O
is	O
characterized	O
by	O
early	O
onset	O
(	O
within	O

of	O
life	O
)	O
cardiomyopathy	B-DS
and	O
lactic	B-DS
acidosis	I-DS
that	O
causes	O
death	O
in	O
infancy	O
.	O

Some	O
patients	O
who	O
carry	O
at	O

one	O

form	O

have	O
a	O
markedly	O
better	O
prognosis	O
.	O

These	O
patients	O
usually	O
develop	O
cardiomyopathy	B-DS
in	O
later	O
stages	O
.	O

They	O
can	O
survive	O
even	O
through	O
their	O
5th	O

of	O
life	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
extreme	O

they	O
may	O
only	O

Currently	O

no	O

this	O

it	O
