First	O

we	O
provide	O
a	O
taxonomy	O
of	O
how	O
social	O
value	O
is	O
employed	O
in	O
the	O
bioethics	O
literature	O

We	O
then	O
describe	O
the	O
anthropological	O
concept	O
of	O

and	O
show	O
how	O
using	O
the	O

of	O

can	O
illuminate	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
extant	O
conceptual	O
issues	O
with	O

Thereafter	O
,	O
we	O
offer	O
examples	O
to	O
illustrate	O
the	O
potential	O
advantages	O
of	O
re	O
‐	O
visiting	O
the	O
processes	O
of	O

and	O
social	O
value	O

this	O
lens	O
,	O
while	O
also	O
reflecting	O
on	O
possible	O
disadvantages	O

Normatively	O
,	O
this	O
culminates	O
in	O
a	O
schema	O
of	O
five	O
elements	O
(	O
or	O
queries	O
),	O
that	O
are	O
inspired	O
by	O
this	O
heuristic	O
and	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
applied	O
to	O
health	O
research	O
endeavours	O
to	O
evaluate	O
their	O
evolving	O
social	O

iteratively	O
,	O
robustly	O
,	O
and	O
coherently	O

Finally	O
,	O
we	O
propose	O
the	O
example	O
of	O
meaningful	O
patient	O
and	O
stakeholder	O
engagement	O
as	O
a	O
paradigm	O

it	O

From	O

we	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O

three	O

—	O

roles	O

,	O
social	O
value	O

.	O

Within	O
this	O
reading	O
of	O
social	O
value	O
,	O
two	O
normative	O
appeals	O
are	O
frequently	O
found	O
:	O
(	O
i	O
)	O
to	O
justify	O
resource	O
allocation	O
to	O
research	O
,	O
12	O
and	O
(	O
ii	O
)	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
risk	O
and	O
burdens	O
associated	O
with	O
research	O
.	O
13	O
Third	O
,	O
social	O
value	O
is	O
employed	O
as	O
a	O
protective	O
device	O
:	O

not	O

exploitative	O
–	O

and	O
perhaps	O
also	O

(	O
because	O
indirect	O
risks	O
and	O
resource	O
use	O
are	O
not	O
otherwise	O
justified	O
).	O

This	O
appeal	O
aims	O
at	O
preventing	O
research	O
and	O
its	O
actors	O
from	O
taking	O
unfair	O
advantage	O
of	O
individuals	O
and	O
of	O
society	O
.	O

Importantly	O
,	O
these	O
three	O
roles	O
are	O
not	O
mutually	O
exclusive	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
an	O
appeal	O
to	O

can	O
be	O
an	O
appeal	O
to	O
perform	O
all	O

does	O
in	O
the	O
proposed	O

While	O
all	O
three	O
roles	O
of	O

are	O
crucial	O
to	O

junctures	O

Why	O
Liminality	O

The	O
anthropological	O

This	O
focus	O
on	O

emerged	O
through	O
early	O
ethnographic	O
research	O
of	O
ritual	O
practices	O
that	O

Emanuel	O

call	O

one	O
of	O

criteria	O
for	O

whether	O

This	O
makes	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

We	O

that	O
viewing	O
research	O

a	O

for	O

(	O

the	O

and	O
as	O

we	O

that	O

the	O

43	O
Moreover	O

to	O
